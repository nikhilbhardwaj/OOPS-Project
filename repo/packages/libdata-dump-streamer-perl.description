Module for serializing a data structure as perl code
	
data::dump::streamer is a perl module that serializes scalars, objects or
reference variables and provides their contents in perl syntax. special data
structures including closures, self-referential structures and objects are
output correctly. this module is very similar in concept to the core module
data::dumper, except this module is designed to output to a stream instead
of constructing its output in memory (trading speed for memory).
