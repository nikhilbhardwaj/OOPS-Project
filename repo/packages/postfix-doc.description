Documentation for postfix
	
postfix is wietse venema's mail transport agent that started life as an

 alternative to the widely-used sendmail program.  postfix attempts to
 be fast, easy to administer, and secure, while at the same time being
 sendmail compatible enough to not upset existing users. thus, the outside
 has a sendmail-ish flavor, but the inside is completely different.

this package provides the documentation for postfix.
