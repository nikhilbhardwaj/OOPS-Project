A library for playing ogg multimedia (debugging symbols)
	
a library designed to allow drop-in playback of xiph.org media in an
application. liboggplay handles demuxing and decoding, generates timestamps for
raw data, maintains synchronisation across multiple streams, and provides a
lock-free buffer implementation for easy multithreading.

this package contains debugging symbols useful for tracing bugs in the
liboggplay1 package.
