Java date and time api
	
joda-time provides a quality replacement for the java date and time
classes. the design allows for multiple calendar systems, while still
providing a simple api. the 'default' calendar is the iso8601 standard
which is used by xml. the gregorian, julian, buddhist, coptic, ethiopic
and islamic systems are also included, and we welcome further
additions. supporting classes include time zone, duration, format and
parsing.
