Module for creating a minimal mirror of cpan
	
cpan::mini provides a simple mechanism to build and update a minimal mirror of
the cpan on your local disk.  it contains only those files needed to install
the newest version of every distribution.

this package also contains the minicpan commandline utility, which is a thin
wrapper around the cpan::mini module, which creates and updates local cpan
mirrors without the need write a single line of perl code.
