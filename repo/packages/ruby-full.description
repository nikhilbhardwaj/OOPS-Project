Ruby full installation
	
for many good reasons, the ruby programming language is split in many
small different packages. installing this package will make sure you have
all the packages that add up to a full ruby installation, with the exception
of the tcl/tk bindings for ruby, which are only recommended.

this package installs the dependencies for the current stable
version of ruby, which is 1.8.
