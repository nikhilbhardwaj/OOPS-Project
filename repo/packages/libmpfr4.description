Multiple precision floating-point computation
	
mpfr provides a library for multiple-precision floating-point computation
with correct rounding.  the computation is both efficient and has a
well-defined semantics. it copies the good ideas from the
ansi/ieee-754 standard for double-precision floating-point arithmetic
(53-bit mantissa).
