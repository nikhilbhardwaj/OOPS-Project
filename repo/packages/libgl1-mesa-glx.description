A free implementation of the opengl api -- glx runtime
	
this version of mesa provides glx and dri capabilities: it is capable of
both direct and indirect rendering.  for direct rendering, it can use dri
modules from the libgl1-mesa-dri package to accelerate drawing.

this package does not include the modules themselves: these can be found
in the libgl1-mesa-dri package.

for a complete description of mesa, please look at the
libgl1-mesa-swx11 package.
