An xml toolkit for haskell (library)
	
the haskell xml toolbox bases on the ideas of haxml and hxml, but
introduces a more general and flexible approach for processing xml
with haskell. the haskell xml toolbox uses a generic data model for
representing xml documents, including the dtd subset and the document
subset, in haskell. this data model makes it possible to use filter
functions as a uniform design of xml processing applications. the
processing filters are implemented as arrows. this is more flexible
than the filter approach from hxml and haxml, but all filter
applications can easily be transformed into arrows.

this package contains the libraries compiled for ghc 6.
