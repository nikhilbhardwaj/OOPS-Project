Conversion utilities for qt3 development
	
this package contains some older qt tools (namely qt20fix qtrename140,
qm2ts, mergetr, findtr and msg2qm). these tools are needed only by
application developers who need to migrate any qt application written
for qt 1.x or 2.x over to qt 3.x. the purpose of the tools are to
help fixing the changes with include file renaming as well as migrating
the message file format of qt 2 translation files or any gettext-based
translation system to the qt 3 system.
