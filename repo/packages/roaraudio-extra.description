Extra utilities for roaraudio
	
roaraudio is a server for audio mixing. its main purpose is to mix audio from
different clients before sending it to its outputs (for example a soundcard).
it is completely network transparent (unix sockets, tcp/ip, decnet) and
supports many common codecs like ogg vorbis, speex or flac.

utilities which are not necessary for running roaraudio and which need
extra dependencies are in this package (like roarshout and roarvorbis).
