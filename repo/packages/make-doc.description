Documentation for the gnu version of the "make" utility.
	
this package contains the documentation for gnu make.  the upstream
sources for this package are available at the location
ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/make/. this package has been stripped down to
only contain the documentation; since the documentation is covered
under a non-free license and thus has been moved to
non-free/doc. make itself remains in debian.
