Trivial file transfer protocol server
	
tftpd is a server which supports the internet trivial file transfer protocol
(rfc 783).  the tftp server operates at the port indicated in the `tftp'
service description; see services(5).  the server is normally started by
inetd(8).
tftpd is not suitable for use with the pxe bootloader; for that,
use atftpd or tftpd-hpa.
