Perl module to manipulate perl module names
	
module::util provides useful functions to manipulate module names. its main
aim is to centralise some of the functions commonly used by modules that
manipulate other modules in some way, like converting module names to relative
paths.

it also provides some general utility functions for working with modules, such
as determining whether a string "looks like" a module name, or testing if a
module is loaded (using %inc magic).
