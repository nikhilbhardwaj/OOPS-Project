Framework for sip modules
	
net::sip is a perl framework that provides many useful tools with which to
write software for sip endpoints (e.g phones, answer machines), sip proxies
and registrars. it contains no gui and no real code for working with video
or audio, though it does have some support for rtp (no rtcp) and working with
pcmu/8000 data, enough for sending pcmu/8000 encoded audio to a sip peer and
for receiving and saving pcmu/8000 audio data.
