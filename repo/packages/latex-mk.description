Tool for managing latex projects
	
latex-mk is a collection of makefile fragments and shell scripts for
managing small to large sized latex projects. the typical latex-mk
input file is simply a series of variable definitions in a makefile
for the project. after creating a simple makefile the user can easily
perform all required steps to do such tasks as: preview the document,
print the document, or produce a pdf file. latex-mk will keep track
of files that have changed and how to run the various programs that
are needed to produce the output.
