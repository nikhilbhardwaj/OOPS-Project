Bsd-like finger daemon with qmail support
	
yet another finger daemon.  mimics the output and behavior of the original
bsd daemon.  does not need to be run as root, has support for pgp keys,
qmail mailboxes and qmail dash-extended usernames.  generally paranoid
about account probes, while still allows search by full name.  users can
control if they can be fingered or not.  uses tcpwrappers.
