Orsa framework library (development files)
	
orbit reconstruction, simulation and analysis (orsa) is a framework
for celestial mechanics investigations. the main goals of the project
are the implementation of state of the art orbit integration
algorithms, with concerns on accuracy and performance, and the
development of a number of analysis tools.

this package contains header files, static libraries and symbolic
links that developers using the orsa library will need.
