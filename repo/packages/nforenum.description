A format correcter and linter for the nfo programming language
	
the nfo programming language is used in the graphic file format from the
transport tycoon deluxe, ttdpatch and openttd games.

it takes as input any number of files that contain something that vaguely
resembles valid nfo, and produces, to the best of its ability, encodable nfo
files, one for each input file.

it also detects and warns about some common mistakes made in nfo coding. a
pretty-printer is also included.
