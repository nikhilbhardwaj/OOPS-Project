The (experimental) gnu gold linker utility
	
gold is a new linker, still in development, which is faster than the
current linker included in binutils. it currently fails to link some
applications and libraries (i.e. won't link usable kernels).

this package diverts the gnu linker (ld) with the experimental gold
linker.
