Minimal dumb-terminal emulation program
	
picocom was designed to serve as a simple, manual, modem
configuration, testing, and debugging tool. it has also served (quite
well) as a low-tech "terminal-window" to allow operator intervention
in ppp connection scripts (something like the ms-windows "open
terminal window before / after dialing" feature). it could also prove
useful in many other similar tasks. it is ideal for embedded systems
since its memory footprint is minimal.
