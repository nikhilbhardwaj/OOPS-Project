Figure out the long (fully-qualified) hostname
	
this module determines the host full name on multiple operating
systems (macos, windows, unix-like systems; more later.)

the sys::hostname class is the best and standard way to get the basic
hostname, but that may not be fully qualified.  this module tries to
determine the host's fully qualified name.
