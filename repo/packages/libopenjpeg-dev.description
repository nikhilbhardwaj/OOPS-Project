Development files for libopenjpeg2, a jpeg 2000 image library
	
libopenjpeg2 is a library for handling the jpeg 2000 image compression format.
jpeg 2000 is a wavelet-based image compression standard and permits progressive
transmission by pixel and resolution accuracy for progressive downloads of an
encoded image. it supports lossless and lossy compression, supports higher
compression than jpeg 1991, and has resilience to errors in the image.
