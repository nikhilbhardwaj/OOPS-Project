Easy-to-use interface to the xapian search engine
	
xapian provides a low level interface, dealing with terms and
documents, but not really worrying about where terms come from, or how
to build searches to match the way in which data has been indexed.  in
contrast, xappy allows you to design a field structure, specifying what
kind of information is held in particular fields, and then uses this
field structure to index data appropriately, and to build and perform
searches.
