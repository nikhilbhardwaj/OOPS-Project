Qt 3 compatibility library for qt 4
	
qt is a cross-platform c++ application framework. qt's primary feature
is its rich set of widgets that provide standard gui functionality.

the qt3support module provides classes that ease porting from qt 3 to qt 4.

it allows applications designed to use deprecated qt 3 classes and functions
to work with qt 4, with help from the qt3to4 porting tool found in the
libqt4-dev package.
