An snmp library implementation based on glib and gnet (development files)
	
these are the files needed to compile programs using gsnmp

gnet-snmp is an snmp library implementation based on glib and gnet. this
library has been developed as part of the scli package (an snmp command
line interface). some examples demonstrating the api can be found in the
examples directory. some examples use stub files generated by the smidump
mib compiler, which is part of the libsmi package.
