Visual simulator of 1 and 2-dimensional vibrations
	
good vibrations (gvb) is a small program that aims at providing a nice
interface to play with waves in 1 or 2 dimensions.

it features several ways of setting initial conditions, as well as different
calculation methods and graphic outputs. it is also possible to dump animation
frames to png images in order to make a movie with them.

it relies on the python library scipy to get the best possible performance in
calculations.
