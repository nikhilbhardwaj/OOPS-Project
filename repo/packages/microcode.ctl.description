Intel ia32/ia64 cpu microcode utility
	
the microcode_ctl utility is a companion to the ia32 microcode
driver:


 - it decodes and sends new microcode to the kernel driver for intel ia32
   family (pentium pro, pii, celeron, piii, xeon, pentium 4, etc.) and
   intel x86_64 family processors;
 - it signals the kernel driver to release any buffers it may hold.


the microcode update does not permanently alter the cpu and must be
performed each time the system is booted.
