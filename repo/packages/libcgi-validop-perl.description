Module for validating cgi parameters
	
cgi::validop is a perl module that validates cgi parameters and manages run
modes. because cgi parameter validation is boring, it's easy to get wrong or
ignore. it removes as much of the repetition as possible out of this task by
replacing it with a simple interface.
