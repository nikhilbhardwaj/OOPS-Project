Mongrel plugin to manage a cluster of mongrel servers
	
mongrel_cluster is a plugin that wrappers the mongrel http server and
simplifies the deployment of webapps using a cluster of mongrel servers.
mongrel_cluster will conveniently configure and control several mongrel
servers, or groups of mongrel servers, which are then load balanced using
a reverse proxy solution. typical load balancing reverse proxies include
apache, lighttpd, pound, pen and balance.
