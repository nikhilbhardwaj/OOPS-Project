Get rid of those wingdows viruses!
	
ever get the feeling that nothing is going right?  you're a sysadmin, and
someone's trying to destroy your computers.  the little people running
around the screen are trying to infect your computers with wingdows [tm],
a virus cleverly designed to resemble a popular operating system.  your
objective is to click the mouse on them, ending their potential threat.
if one of the people reaches a computer, it will attempt to replace your
operating system with the virus it carries. it will then attempt to run off
the screen with your vital software.
