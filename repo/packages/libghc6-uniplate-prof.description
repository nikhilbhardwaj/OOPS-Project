Profiling libraries for uniform type generic traversals
	

the haskell uniplate library abstracts over common traversals and queries in a
simple manner allowing the user to scrap their boilerplate code.

a more complete document on the uniplate class was published at the haskell
workshop 2007 (http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~ndm/uniplate/),  along with a
video presentation, and the associated thesis chapter.

this package contains the profiling libraries compiled for ghc 6.
