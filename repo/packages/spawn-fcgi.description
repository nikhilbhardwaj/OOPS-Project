A fastcgi process spawner
	
spawn-fcgi allows fcgi processes to be separated from web server process :

  * easy creation of chmoded socket.
  * privilege separation without needing a suid-binary,
    or running a server as root.
  * you can restart your web server and the fastcgi applications
    without restarting the others.
  * you can run them in different chroot()s.
  * running your fastcgi applications doesnâ€™t depend on the web server
    you are running, which allows for easier testing of/migration
    to other web servers.
