Nss module for using mysql as a naming service
	
libnss-mysql-bg provides a name service switch module that allows mysql
to act as a name service.

its configuration is very flexible by allowing to set an sql query per nss
call (getpwnam, getpwuid, ...). you would use it instead of the other
"libnss-mysql" package for building an nss over an existing database (used for
another purpose like groupware, ...).

it currently supports storage of passwd, group and shadow informations.
