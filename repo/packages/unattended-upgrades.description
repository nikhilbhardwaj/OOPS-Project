Automatic installation of security upgrades
	
this package can download and install security upgrades automatically
and unattended, taking care to only install packages from the
configured apt source, and checking for dpkg prompts about
configuration file changes.

this script is the backend for the apt::periodic::unattended-upgrade
option.
