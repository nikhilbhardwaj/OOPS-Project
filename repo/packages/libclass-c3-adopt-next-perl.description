Drop-in replacement for next, using class::c3 to do the hard work
	
class::c3::adopt::next is intended as a drop-in replacement for next,
supporting the same interface, but using class::c3 to do the hard work. you
can then write new code without next, and migrate individual source files to
use class::c3 or method modifiers as appropriate, at whatever pace you're
comfortable with.
