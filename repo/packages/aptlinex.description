Web browser addon to install debian packages with a click
	
this addon allows installing debian packages from iceweasel, firefox,
galeon or konqueror just clicking on a web link.

for this to work, links need to have an url beginning with apt://
this package does not install the packages or download them from the
web sites, it just launches apt, passing the package name to install
as a parameter to apt.

some screenshots to see how it works are available at
