Namespace control and lazy-import mechanism for python
	
with apipkg you can control the exported namespace of a python package and
greatly reduce the number of imports for your users. it is a small pure
python module that works on virtually all python versions, including
cpython2.3 to python3.1, jython and pypy. it co-operates well with python's
help() system, custom importers (pep302) and common command line completion
tools.
