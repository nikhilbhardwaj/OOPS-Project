Kernel for solving general timetabling problems
	
tablix is a powerful free software kernel for solving general
timetabling problems. it uses a coarse-grained parallel genetic
algorithm in combination with other techniques to construct
sensible timetables from xml formatted problem descriptions.
tablix can run on a single host as well as on a heterogeneous
parallel virtual machine using pvm3.
