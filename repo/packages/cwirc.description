X-chat morse plugin
	
cwirc is a plugin for the x-chat irc client to transmit raw morse code over
the internet using irc servers as reflectors. the transmitted morse code can
be received in near real-time by other x-chat clients with the cwirc plugin.
cwirc tries to emulate a standard amateur radio rig : it sends and receives
morse over virtual channels, and it can listen to multiple senders transmitting
on the same channel. morse code is keyed locally using a straight or iambic
key connected to a serial port, or using the mouse buttons, and the sound is
played through the soundcard.
