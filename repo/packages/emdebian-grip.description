Support for the grip flavour of emdebian
	
supports on-the-fly conversion of regular debian packages
into 'gripped' packages that have no debian documentation,
manpages or infopages using deb_build_options.

supports the extension of emdebian grip to packages that
are not currently available from the grip repository, by
machines already running emdebian grip.

this package does not depend on the rest of emdebian-tools.
