Parser for json-based configuration files
	
config::json is a perl module capable of parsing and writing configuration
files written in javascript object notation (json). it supports arbitrary
file inclusion (even hierarchical includes) and comments in the file. it is
beneficial in environments that already use json, since the parser is already
loaded into memory.
