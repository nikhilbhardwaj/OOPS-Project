Gnome accessibility implementation library -- shared libraries
	
gail implements atk interfaces for gtk+ widgets which are dynamically
loadable at runtime by a gtk+ application. once loaded, those parts of
an application that use standard gtk+ widgets will have a basic level
of accessibility, without the need to modify the application at all.

this package contains the shared library.
