Base class for dynamic factory classes
	
this is a simple module that factory classes can use to generate new
types of objects on the fly, providing a consistent interface to common
groups of objects.

factory classes are used when you have different implementations for
the same set of tasks but may not know in advance what implementations
you will be using.  with a factory class this is easy.  class::factory
even provides a simple constructor for you.
