X font server
	
xfs is a daemon that listens on a network port and serves x fonts to x
servers (and thus to x clients).  all x servers have the ability to serve
locally installed fonts for themselves, but xfs makes it possible to offload
that job from the x server, and/or have a central repository of fonts on a
networked machine running xfs so that all the machines running x servers on a
network do not require their own set of fonts.  xfs may also be invoked by
users to, for instance, make available x fonts in user accounts that are not
available to the x server or to an already running system xfs.
