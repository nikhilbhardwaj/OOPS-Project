Implementation of the mcilroy-hunt longest common subsequence algorithm
	
diff::lcs is a port of algorithm::diff that uses the mcilroy-hunt
longest common subsequence (lcs) algorithm to compute intelligent
differences between two sequenced enumerable containers. the
implementation is based on mario i. wolczko's smalltalk version

this is a dependency package, which depends on a libdifflcs package
built for the default ruby version.
