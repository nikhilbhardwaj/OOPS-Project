Customizable weather plasmoid (cwp)
	
this is another weather plasmoid.

it aims to be highly customizable, but a little harder to setup than other
weather plasmoids. nearly any weather forecast provider can be used,
as long as the data is provided as html files (no flash).

the information how to extract the information from these html files is
stored inside xml files. commands like grep, head, tail, sed, awk, ... will
do this job.
