Perl module to validate moose method parameters
	
moosex::params::validate fills a gap in moose by adding method parameter
validation to moose, providing a simple way to verify that incoming parameters
are of the appropriate moose types and roles. this module is just one of many
developing options to do this sort of thing; it should not yet be considered
the "official" way to validate parameters.
