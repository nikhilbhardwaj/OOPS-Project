Stub code generator for objective caml
	
camlidl generates stub code for interfacing caml with c from an idl
description of the c functions.  thus, camlidl automates the most
tedious task in interfacing c libraries with caml programs.

it can also be used to interface caml programs with other languages, as
long as those languages have a well-defined c interface.

this package contains the camlidl executable.
