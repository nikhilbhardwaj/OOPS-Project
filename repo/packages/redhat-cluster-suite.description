Red hat cluster suite - metapackage
	
rhcs is a cluster management infrastructure, for building
high-availability multi-node clusters with service and ip failover on
top of shared fibre channel/iscsi storage devices.

the only scope for this package is to install the full red hat cluster suite
in one operation. it is safe to remove it.
