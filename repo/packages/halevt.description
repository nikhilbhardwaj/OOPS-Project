Generic handler for hal events
	
halevt is a daemon that acts as a policy agent on top of the hardware
abstraction layer. it
listens to hal events and reacts with user-configurable
actions. halevt is a reimplementation of the ivman project.

among other things, halevt is useful as an automount daemon that will mount
removable devices, but with a much smaller set of dependencies than tools such
as gnome-volume-manager.
