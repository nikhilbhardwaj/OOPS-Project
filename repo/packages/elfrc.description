Convert arbitrary files into elf objects
	
elfrc is a program which can turn arbitrary files into elf object files which
can then be linked into your program directly and accessed via simple,
user-defined symbol names.

for instance, it's possible to embed even huge (16mb+) files directly into the
executable and then access the data in constant time without making the
compiler or linker eat loads of memory.
