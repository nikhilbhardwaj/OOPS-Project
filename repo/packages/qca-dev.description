Qt cryptographic architecture - development files
	
taking a hint from the similarly-named java cryptography architecture,
qca aims to provide a straightforward and cross-platform crypto api,
using qt datatypes and conventions. qca separates the api from the
implementation, using plugins known as providers. the advantage of
this model is to allow applications to avoid linking to or explicitly
depending on any particular cryptographic library. this allows one to
easily change or upgrade crypto implementations without even needing
to recompile the application!

this package contains the files necessary to compile applications
using qca.

qca version 1 is deprecated - use qca2 if possible.
