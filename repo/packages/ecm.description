Prepares cd image files so they compress better
	
the ecm format allows you to reduce the size of a typical cd image file
(bin, cdi, nrg, ccd, or any other format that uses raw sectors).
it works by eliminating the error correction/detection codes (ecc/edc) from
each sector whenever possible. the encoder automatically adjusts to
different sector types and automatically skips any headers it encounters.
since the data skipped is nearly impossible to compress with traditionnal
tools, the resulting ecm file will compress far better than the raw cd image.
