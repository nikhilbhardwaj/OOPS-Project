Python module for generating postscript graphics
	
pyx is a python module for generating encapsulated postscript figures using
an abstraction of postscript and tex.

the module provides access to postscript features such as paths,
line-styles, fill patterns, transformations, and clipping. geometric
operations on paths such as intersections, transformations, and splitting
are also supported.

pyx also allows flexible graph generation with many different graph and
axis styles.
