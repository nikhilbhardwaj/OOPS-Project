Attach and detach slave interfaces to a bonding device
	
this is a tool to attach and detach slave network interfaces to a bonding
device. a bonding device will act like a normal ethernet network device to
the kernel, but will send out the packets via the slave devices using a simple
round-robin scheduler. this allows for simple load-balancing, identical to
"channel bonding" or "trunking" techniques used in switches.

the kernel must have support for bonding devices for ifenslave to be useful.
this package supports 2.6.x kernels and the most recent 2.4.x kernels.
