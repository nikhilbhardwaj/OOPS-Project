Simplistic perl interface to pkg-config
	
the pkg-config program retrieves information about installed libraries,
usually for the purposes of compiling against and linking to them.

extutils::pkgconfig is a very simplistic interface to this utility, intended
for use in the makefile.pl of perl extensions which bind libraries that
pkg-config knows. it is really just boilerplate code that you would've
written yourself.
