A software package for semidefinite programming
	
csdp is a library of routines that implements a predictor corrector variant of
the semidefinite programming algorithm of helmberg, rendl, vanderbei, and
wolkowicz. the code runs in parallel on shared memory multi-processor systems,
and it makes effective use of sparsity in the constraint matrices.

csdp is part of the larger coin-or initiative (computational infrastructure
for operations research).

this package contains the binaries.
