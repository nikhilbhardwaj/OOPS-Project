Helper scripts to make filesystems immutable
	
this is a set of scripts that make immutable the root and other filesystems.
using aufs they pack a tmpfs filesystem and the filesystem forcing
changes to be written to the tmpfs.

the root filesystem is protected by an initramfs script. other filesystems
are protected by an init script. all protected filesystems become read-only
ensuring their immutability even on power-offs.

this can be used for public computers to prevent damage or changes.
