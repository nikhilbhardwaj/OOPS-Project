Paperless money transfer with german banks on floppies
	
this package contains a library that can read and write german dtaus
files.  dtaus is an acronym for datentraegeraustausch.  it is used by
german credit institutes in order to transfer commands for money
exchanges between accounts.  this format is used both between banks
and between banks and their customers.  one mainly wants to use it to
be able to do automatic "bankeinzuege".

this package probably will only be useful in germany.
