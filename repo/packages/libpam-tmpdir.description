Automatic per-user temporary directories
	
many programs use $tmpdir for storing temporary files.  not
all of them are good at securing the permissions of those
files.  libpam-tmpdir sets $tmpdir and $tmp for pam sessions
and sets the permissions quite tight.  this helps system
security by having an extra layer of security, making such
symlink attacks and other /tmp based attacks harder or
impossible
