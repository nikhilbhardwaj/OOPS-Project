The gnu bourne again shell
	
bash is an sh-compatible command language interpreter that executes
commands read from the standard input or from a file.  bash also
incorporates useful features from the korn and c shells (ksh and csh).

bash is ultimately intended to be a conformant implementation of the
ieee posix shell and tools specification (ieee working group 1003.2).

the programmable completion code, by ian macdonald, is now found in
the bash-completion package.
