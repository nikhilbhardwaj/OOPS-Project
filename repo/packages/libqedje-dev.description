Ui interface library which separates design from logic
	
qedje extends the qt toolkit with the flexibility of the edje
declarative language.

edje is a declarative language that simplifies the development of
complex interfaces separating the ui design from the application
logic, by providing animations, layouts and simple scripts in a very
small memory footprint.

this package contains the development header files.
