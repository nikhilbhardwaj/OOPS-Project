Html::mason example setup
	
mason allows web pages and sites to be constructed from shared,
reusable building blocks called components. components contain a mix
of perl and html, and can call each other and pass values back and
forth like subroutines. components increase modularity and eliminate
repetitive work: common design elements (headers, footers, menus,
logos) can be extracted into their own components where they need be
changed only once to affect the whole site.

this package will set up some example mason components in your local
apache.
