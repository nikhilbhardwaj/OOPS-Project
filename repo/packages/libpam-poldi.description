Pam module allowing authentication using a openpgp smartcard
	
this pam module will allow you to login, screenlock and validate to
services using your gnupg smartcard.
you might have expected to find this with a name of libpam-pgp, libpam-gpg,
libpam-openpgp or libpam-gnupg.

this code is considered experimental and needs more testing. it is, however,
already used for the daily login.
