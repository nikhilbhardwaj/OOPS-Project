Programmable dns resolver class for offline emulation of dns
	
net::dns::resolver::programmable is a net::dns::resolver descendant class that
allows a virtual dns to be emulated instead of querying the real dns.  a set
of static dns records may be supplied, or arbitrary code may be specified as a
means for retrieving dns records, or even generating them on the fly.
