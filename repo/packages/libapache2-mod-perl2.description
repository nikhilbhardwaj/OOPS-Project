Integration of perl with the apache2 web server
	
mod_perl allows the use of perl for just about anything
apache-related, including <perl> sections in the config
files and the famous apache::registry module for caching
compiled scripts.

it can produce anywhere from a 400% to 2000% speed increase
on sites using perl scripts, and is used on many large script-
based web sites - for example, http://slashdot.org.
