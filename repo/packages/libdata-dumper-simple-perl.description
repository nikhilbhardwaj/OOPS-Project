Easily dump variables together with their names (data::dumper-like)
	
this module allows the user to dump variables in a data::dumper format.
unlike the default behavior of data::dumper, the variables are named
(instead of $var1, $var2, etc.)  data::dumper provides an extended
interface that allows the programmer to name the variables, but this
interface requires a lot of typing and is prone to tyops (sic).  this
module fixes that.
