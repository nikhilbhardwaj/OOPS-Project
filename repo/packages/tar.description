Gnu version of the tar archiving utility
	
tar is a program for packaging a set of files as a single archive in tar
format.  the function it performs is conceptually similar to cpio, and to
things like pkzip in the dos world.  it is heavily used by the debian package
management system, and is useful for performing system backups and exchanging
sets of files with others.
