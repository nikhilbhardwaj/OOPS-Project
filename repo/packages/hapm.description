Light and fast high availability port monitor
	
high availability port monitor (hapm) is an application to check the local
ports status. it is a simple, light and fast daemon to check tcp/udp ports.

hapm works with heartbeat daemon. heartbeat is an essential element used
in high availability projects.

if one or more monitored ports (per ip) go down then the primary
heartbeat will be killed by hapm and the secondary host will take over
virtual ip.
