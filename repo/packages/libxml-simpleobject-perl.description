Objectoriented perl interface to a parsed xml::parser tree
	
xml::simpleobject is a short and simple class allowing simple object
access to a parsed xml::parser tree, with methods for fetching children
and attributes in as clean a manner as possible.

this is a small and quick module, with easy and compact usage. see
xml::simpleobject::libxml for the same interface for xml::libxml.
