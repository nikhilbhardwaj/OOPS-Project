Weak-signal amateur radio communications
	
wsjt is designed to facilitate amateur radio communication under extreme
weak-signal conditions.  three very different coding and modulation
methods are provided: one for communication by "meteor scatter"
techniques on the vhf bands; one for meteor and ionospheric scatter,
primarily on the 6 meter band; and one for the very challenging
eme (earth-moon-earth) path.
