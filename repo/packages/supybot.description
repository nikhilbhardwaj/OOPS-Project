supybot is a robust (it doesn't crash), user friendly (it's easy
to configure) and programmer friendly (plugins are *extremely*
easy to write) python irc bot.  it aims to be an adequate
replacement for most existing irc bots.  it includes a very
flexible and powerful acl system for controlling access to
commands, as well as more than 50 builtin plugins providing
around 400 actual commands.
