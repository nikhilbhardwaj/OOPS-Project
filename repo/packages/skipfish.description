Fully automated, active web application security reconnaissance tool
	
skipfish is an active web application security reconnaissance tool. it prepares
an interactive sitemap for the targeted site by carrying out a recursive crawl
and dictionary-based probes. the resulting map is then annotated with the
output from a number of active (but hopefully non-disruptive) security checks.
the final report generated by the tool is meant to serve as a foundation for
professional web application security assessments.
