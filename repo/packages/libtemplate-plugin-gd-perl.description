Gd plugin(s) for the template toolkit
	
this package provides a number of template toolkit plugin modules to
interface with lincoln stein's gd modules. these in turn provide an
interface to thomas boutell's gd graphics library.

these plugins were distributed as part of the template toolkit until
version 2.15 released in february 2006. at this time they were
extracted into this separate distribution.
