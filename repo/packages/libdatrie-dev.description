Development files for double-array trie library
	
trie is a kind of digital search tree, an efficient indexing method with
o(1) time complexity for searching. comparably as efficient as hashing,
trie also provides flexibility on incremental matching and key spelling
manipulation. this makes it ideal for lexical analyzers, as well as
spelling dictionaries.

this library is an implementation of double-array structure for representing
trie, as proposed by junichi aoe. the details of the implementation can be
found at http://linux.thai.net/~thep/datrie/datrie.html

this package contains the development libraries, header files and manpages
you need to develop your programs using the datrie library.
