Daemon for using 3d input devices from 3dconnexion
	
spacenavd, is a free software replacement user-space driver (daemon),
for 3dconnexion's six-degree-of-freedom input devices. it is
compatible with the original 3dxsrv proprietary daemon provided by
3dconnexion, and works perfectly with any program that was written
for the 3dconnexion driver. it also offers another method
of accessing the device via a new non-x11-dependent protocol.
