Groovy build framework based on scripting ant tasks
	
gant is a build tool for scripting ant tasks using groovy instead of
xml to specify the build logic. a gant build specification is a
groovy script and so can bring all the power of groovy to bear
directly, something not possible with ant scripts. whilst it might be
seen as a competitor to ant, gant uses ant tasks for many of the
actions, so gant is really an alternative way of doing builds using
ant, but using a programming language rather than xml to specify the
build rules.
