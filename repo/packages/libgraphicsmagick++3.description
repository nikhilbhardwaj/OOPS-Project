Format-independent image processing - c++ shared library
	
graphicsmagick provides libraries in several programming languages to read,
write and manipulate image files across a large number of formats, from the
widely used jpeg, tiff, bmp or xpm to special-purpose formats such as fits or
image formats found on some photo cds. there are functions for finegrained
image processing tasks, as well as conversion routines between the various
image formats.

the graphicsmagick library is a fork of imagemagick and therefore offers
an interface that is similar in features, but intended to be more stable
across releases. while compatibility does not go so far that the
graphicsmagick library serves as a drop-in replacement for imagemagick,
conversion can usually be done with little effort.

this package contains the c++ libraries needed to run executables that use
the graphicsmagick++ library.
