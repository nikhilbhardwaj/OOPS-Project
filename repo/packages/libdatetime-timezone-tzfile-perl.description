Perl handling of tzfile (zoneinfo) timezone files
	
an instance of this class represents a timezone that was encoded in a file in
the tzfile(5) format. these can express arbitrary patterns of offsets from
universal time, changing over time. offsets and change times are limited to a
resolution of one second.

this class implements the datetime::timezone interface, so that its instances
can be used with datetime objects.
