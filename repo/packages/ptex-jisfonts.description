Provide an environment of jis.tfm and jisg.tfm for ptex/dvips
	
this includes tfm files and vf files for jis.tfm and jisg.tfm which
might produce better output than ordinary/traditional min*.tfm and
goth*.tfm would do.

this package supports to use xdvik-ja, dvipsk-ja, dvi2ps and
dvipdfm(-cjk) with jisfonts.  for the detail of usage, please read
readme.debian after installing this.
