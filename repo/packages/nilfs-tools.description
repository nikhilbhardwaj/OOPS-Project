Continuous snapshotting log-structured filesystem
	
nilfs is a new implementation of a log-structured filesystem. it allows
continuous snapshotting, so that users can restore files mistakenly overwritten
or destroyed even when it happens after the last backup.

this package contains utilities (mkfs, fsck, etc.) used to work with nilfs.
