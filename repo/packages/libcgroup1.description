A library to control and monitor control groups
	
control groups provide a mechanism for aggregating/partitioning sets of tasks,
and all their future children, into hierarchical groups with specialized
behaviour.

this library allows applications to manipulate, control, administrate and
monitor control groups and the associated controllers.
