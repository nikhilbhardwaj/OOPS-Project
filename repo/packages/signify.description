Automatic, semi-random ".signature" rotator/generator
	
signify is a neat little program that allows a random signature to be
generated from a set of rules.  each "section" can be one of an unlimited
number of possibilities, each with its own weighting so those really cool
quotes can appear more often than others.  sections can also be placed next
to each other vertically to create columns.  each section can be formatted
independently as left/right/center and top/bottom/vcenter.  see
http://signify.sf.net/ for more information.
