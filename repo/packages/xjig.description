An x11 jigsaw puzzle
	
xjig is a puzzle that tries to replicate a jigsaw puzzle on the screen
as closely as possible. any gif, jpeg or ppm image may be loaded and cut
into pieces. the goal (as with any jigsaw puzzle) is to reassemble the
original picture.

tiles may be freely rotated by use of the mouse, flipped (for
double-sided puzzles) and even shown as shaped windows on the desktop
(fast machine/video card recommended for the latter!). an example image
is provided in /usr/share/games/xjig .
