Poe component for running asynchronous dbi calls
	
poe::component::dbiagent is your answer to non-blocking dbi in poe.

it fires off a configurable number child processes (defaults to 3) and
feeds database queries to it via two-way pipe (or sockets ... however
poe::component::wheel::run is able to manage it).  the primary method
is query.
