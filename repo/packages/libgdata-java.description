Simple standard protocol for reading and writing data on the web
	
the google data apis provide a simple standard protocol for reading and
writing data on the web. these apis use either of two standard
xml-based syndication formats: atom or rss. they also have a
feed-publishing system that consists of the atom publishing protocol
plus some extensions (using atom's standard extension model) for
handling queries. many google services support the google data api
protocol.
