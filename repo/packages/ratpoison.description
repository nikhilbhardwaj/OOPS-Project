Keyboard-only window manager
	
ratpoison is a simple window manager with no fancy graphics,
no window decorations, and no rodent dependence.
it is largely modelled after gnu screen.

the screen can be split into non-overlapping frames. all
windows are kept maximized inside their frames to take
full advantage of your precious screen real estate.

all interaction with the window manager is done through
keystrokes. ratpoison has a prefix map to minimize
key clobbering.
