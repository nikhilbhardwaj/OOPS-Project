Interface to the glib and gobject libraries
	
glib provides a perl interface to the glib and gobject libraries, as part
of gtk2-perl. it attempts to provide a perlish interface while remaining as
true as possible to the underlying c api, so perusing the reference manual is
recommended (see <url:http://developer.gnome.org/doc/api/2.0/glib/>).
