Zen simulation of robot finding kitten
	
in this simulation, you play the part of robot. your task is to
complete the simulation by finding kitten, as is your destiny, and
indeed your wont.  you (robot) are represented by the # character, and
you move around with the arrow keys touching things.  if the thing you
touch is kitten, you get a cute little animation (which was cuter in
the dos version) and the simulation ends. otherwise, you get a brief
description of what it is you touched.
