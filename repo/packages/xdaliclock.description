Melting digital clock
	
the xdaliclock program displays a digital clock; when a digit changes, it
"melts" into its new shape.

it can display in 12 or 24 hour modes, and displays the date when a mouse
button is held down. it has two large fonts built into it, but it can animate
most other fonts that contain all of the digits. it can also do some funky
psychedelic colormap cycling, and can use the "shape" extension so that the
window is shaped like the digits.
