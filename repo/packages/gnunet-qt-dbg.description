Secure, trust-based peer-to-peer framework (qt client debug)
	
gnunet is a peer-to-peer framework which focuses on providing security. all
link-to-link messages in the network are confidential and authenticated. the
framework provides a transport abstraction layer and can currently encapsulate
the peer-to-peer traffic in udp, tcp, or smtp messages.

this package contains the debugging symbols for the graphical client, using the
qt toolkit.
