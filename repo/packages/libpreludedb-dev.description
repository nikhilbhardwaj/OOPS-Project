parts :

 - the prelude sensors, responsible for generating alerts, such as
   snort featuring a signature engine, plugins for
   protocol analysis, and intrusion detection plugins, and the prelude
   log monitoring lackey.
 - the prelude report server, collecting data from prelude sensors,
   and generating user-readable reports.
