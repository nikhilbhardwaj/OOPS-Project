Small printer daemon intended for diskless workstations
	
p910nd is a small daemon that copies any data received on the port it
is listening on to the corresponding printer port.

it is primarily intended for diskless linux hosts running as printer
drivers but there is no reason why it could not be used on diskful hosts.

port 9100 is copied to /dev/lp0, 9101 to /dev/lp1 and 9102 to /dev/lp2.
the default is port 9100 to /dev/lp0.
