Mit photonic-bands documentation
	
the mit photonic-bands package is a free program for computing the band
structures (dispersion relations) and electromagnetic modes of periodic
dielectric structures, on both serial and parallel computers. it was
developed by steven g. johnson at mit in the joannopoulos ab initio
physics group, and designed to study photonic crystal structures.

this package contains the documentation in html format.
