Development headers for vstream-client
	
vstream-client is a fork off of the vstream library from the
tivo-mplayer project. it has been stripped down to just the
client code, and includes an example client application. if
you have vserver installed on your tivo (which most tivo hackers
do), then you can use this simple client to stream .ty files
from it. mplayer includes support for this library. this
library can be used by mplayer/mencoder to watch/re-encode tivo
streams live over a network.

this package contains the headers for development.
