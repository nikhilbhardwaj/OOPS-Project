Python input filter for doxygen
	
doxypy is an input filter for doxygen. it reformats python comments
to conform to doxygen documentation blocks. this makes it possible
to use the doxygen/javadoc syntax inside of docstrings when writing
code documentation and automatically generate api documentation out
of it instead of being forced to use non-python documentation blocks
or to document code redundantly.
