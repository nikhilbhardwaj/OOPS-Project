Recover files/disks with damaged sectors
	
this program will help you recover disks with bad sectors. you can recover
files as well complete devices. in case if finds sectors which simply cannot be
recoverd, it writes an empty sector to the outputfile and continues.

if you're recovering a cd or a dvd and the program cannot read the sector in
"normal mode", then the program will try to read the sector in "raw mode"
(without error-checking etc.). this toolkit also has a utility called
'mergebad' which merges multiple images into one.
