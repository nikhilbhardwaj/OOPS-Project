Mvc ruby based framework geared for web application development
	
rails is a full-stack, open-source web framework in ruby for writing
real-world applications.

being a full-stack framework means that all layers are built to work
seamlessly together. that way you don't repeat yourself and you can
use a single language from top to bottom. everything from templates to
control flow to business logic is written in ruby.

this is an empty dependency package.
