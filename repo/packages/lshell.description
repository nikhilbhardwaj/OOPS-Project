Restricts a user's shell environment to limited sets of commands
	
lshell is a shell coded in python that lets you restrict a user's environment
to limited sets of commands, choose to enable/disable any command over ssh
(e.g. scp, sftp, rsync, etc.), log user's commands, implement timing
restrictions, and more.
