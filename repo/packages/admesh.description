A tool for processing triangulated solid meshes
	
currently, admesh only reads the stl file
format that is used for rapid prototyping applications,
although it can write stl, vrml, off, and dxf files.
some features of admesh are: fill holes in the mesh
by adding facets. repair facets by connecting
nearby facets. repair normal directions
(i.e. facets should be ccw) remove degenerate
facets (i.e. facets with 2 or more vertices equal)
