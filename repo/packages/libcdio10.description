Library to read and control cd-rom
	
this library is to encapsulate cd-rom reading and
control. applications wishing to be oblivious of the os- and
device-dependant properties of a cd-rom can use this library.

some support for disk image types like bin/cue and nrg is available,
so applications that use this library also have the ability to read
disc images as though they were cd's.
