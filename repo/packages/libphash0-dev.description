Perceptual hashing library development package
	
unlike cryptographic hash functions which rely on an avalanche effect of
changes in input leading to drastic changes in the output, perceptual
hashes are "close" to one another if the inputs are visually or
auditorily similar.

perceptual hashes have applications in searching, identifying potential
copyright infringement, locating duplicates etc. - since a fingerprint
of a file is usually less than 1% of the original media file's size,
the fingerprint can be stored in a database and used for semantic
searching, such as finding all images that look like another.

phash implements several perceptual hashing algorithms and provides a
c++ api to use those functions in your own programs.

this package provides the files necessary to compile programs which
use phash library.
