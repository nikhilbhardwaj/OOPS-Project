Dump intel cpu / chipset configuration parameters
	
inteltool is a tool for dumping the configuration space of
intel cpus, northbridges and southbridges.

this includes register contents of e.g. gpio, rcba, pmbase, mchbar, epbar,
dmibar, pciexbar, and more.

it has been developed for the coreboot project (see http://coreboot.org for
details on coreboot), but may also be useful for other purposes.
