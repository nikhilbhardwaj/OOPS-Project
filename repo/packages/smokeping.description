Latency logging and graphing system
	
smokeping consists of a daemon process which organizes the
latency measurements and a cgi which presents the graphs.

with smokeping you can measure latency and packet loss in your network.
smokeping uses rrdtool to maintain a longterm datastore and to draw pretty
graphs giving up to the minute information on the state of each
network connection.
