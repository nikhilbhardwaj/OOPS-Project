Include constants from pod
	
this module allows you to specify those constants that should be
documented in your pod, and pull them out a run time in a fairly
arbitrary fashion.

pod::constants uses pod::parser to do the parsing of the source file.
it has to open the source file it is called from, and does so directly
either by lookup in %inc or by assuming it is $0 if the caller is
"main" (or it can't find %inc{caller()})
