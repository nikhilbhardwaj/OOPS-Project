A little tool to send magic wake-on-lan packets
	
you can wake up wol compliant computers which have been powered down to
sleep mode or start wol compliant computers with a bios feature.

wol is an abbreviation for wake-on-lan. it is a standard that allows you
to turn on a computer from another location over a network connection.

a feature etherwake seperates from other implementations is, that it also
supports wol passwords.
