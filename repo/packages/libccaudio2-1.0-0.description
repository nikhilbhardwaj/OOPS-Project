Gnu ccaudio2 - a c++ class framework for processing audio files
	
the gnu ccaudio package offers a highly portable c++ class framework for
developing applications which manipulate audio streams and various
disk based audio file formats.  at the moment ccaudio is primarly a class
framework for handling .au, .wav (riff), and various .raw audio encoding
formats under posix and win32 systems, though it may expand to become a
general purpose audio and soundcard support library.  support for
controlling cd audio devices has recently been added as well as support
for codecs and other generic audio processing services.
