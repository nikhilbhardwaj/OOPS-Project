Test module for checking the syntax of use strict and test coverage
	
test::strict tests if the code compiles and inter-operates with
test::simple modules. another good practice this module can test
is to "use strict;" in all perl files.

by setting a minimum test coverage through all_cover_ok(), a code author can
ensure his code is tested above a preset level of kwalitee throughout the
development cycle. along with test::pod, this module can provide the first
tests to setup for a module author.
