Basic inter-process locks
	
the zc.lockfile package provides a basic portable implementation of
interprocess locks using lock files. the purpose if not specifically to lock
files, but to simply provide locks with an implementation based on
file-locking primitives.  of course, these locks could be used to mediate
access to *other* files. for example, the zodb file storage implementation
uses file locks to mediate access to file-storage database files. the database
files and lock file files are separate files.
