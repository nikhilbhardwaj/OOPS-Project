Full-blown mpd client library
	
pococm gives a clear message-passing interface (sitting on top of poe) for
talking to and controlling mpd (music player daemon) servers. a connection to
the mpd server is established as soon as a new pococm object is created.

commands are then sent to the server as messages are passed.
