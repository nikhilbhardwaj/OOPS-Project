Adds pragmata to exporter
	
pragmatic implements a default import method for processing pragmata before
passing the rest of the import to exporter.

perl automatically calls the import method when processing a use statement
for a module. modules and use are documented in perlfunc and perlmod.

(do not confuse pragmatic with pragmatic modules, such as less, strict and
the like. they are standalone pragmata, and are not associated with any other
module.)
