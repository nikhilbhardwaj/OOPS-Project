Common unix printing system(tm) - bsd commands
	
the common unix printing system (or cups(tm)) is a printing system and
general replacement for lpr, lpd and the like.  it supports the
internet printing protocol (ipp), and has its own filtering driver
model for handling various document types.

this package provides the bsd commands for interacting with cups.  it
is provided separately to allow cups to coexist with other printing
systems (to a small degree).
