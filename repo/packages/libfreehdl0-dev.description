Vhdl simulator for linux (development headers)
	
this is a free vhdl simulator with these features:

 * has a graphical waveform viewer.
 * has a source level debugger.
 * is vhdl-93 compliant.


the development headers are needed to compile simulations, not only
to build freehdl based applications.
