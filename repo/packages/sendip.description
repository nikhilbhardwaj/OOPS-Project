A commandline tool to allow sending arbitrary ip packets
	
sendip has a large number of command line options to specify the
content of every header of a rip, tcp, udp, icmp or raw ipv4 and ipv6
packet. it also allows any data to be added to the packet. checksums
can be calculated automatically, but if you wish to send out wrong
checksums, that is supported too.
