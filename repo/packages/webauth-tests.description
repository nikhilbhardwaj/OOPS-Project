Tests for the webauth authentication modules
	
webauth is a cookie-based web authentication system built on top of
kerberos.  it relies on a central authentication server that handles all
user authentication for a domain and creates user authentication
credentials for any web server that needs strong authentication.

this package contains test html files and apache 2 configuration
fragments to test a new installation of the webauth modules.
