Transform digital camera jpeg images
	
exiftran is a command line utility to transform digital image jpeg
images. it can do lossless rotations like jpegtran, but unlike
jpegtran it cares about the exif data: it can rotate images
automatically by checking the exif orientation tag, it updates the
exif informaton if needed (image dimension, orientation), it also
rotates the exif thumbnail. it can process multiple images at once.
