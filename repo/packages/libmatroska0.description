Extensible open standard audio/video container format
	
matroska is aiming to become the standard of multimedia
container formats one day. it is based on ebml (extensible binary
meta language), a kind of binary version of xml. this way the
significant advantages in terms of future format extensability
are gained without breaking file support in old parsers.

this package contains the shared library needed to run applications that
use libmatroska.
