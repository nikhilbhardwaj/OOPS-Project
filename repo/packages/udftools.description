Tools for udf filesystems and dvd/cd-r(w) drives
	
this package contains a number of user-space tools related to
creating filesystems in the udf (universal disk format), which is
primarily used for dvds, but sometimes also cd-roms:


 mkudffs - format a device, creating an empty udf filesystem
 cdrwtool - low-level drive management (e.g. set writing speed, format)
 pktsetup - set up a packet writing device (/dev/pktcdvd0) for a drive
 wrudf - maintains a udf filesystem (undocumented)
