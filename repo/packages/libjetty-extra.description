Java servlet engine and webserver -- extra libraries
	
jetty is an open source http servlet server written in 100% java.
it is designed to be light weight, high performance, embeddable,
extensible and flexible, thus making it an ideal platform for serving
dynamic http requests from any java application.
this package contains the platform-dependent libraries used by jetty.
currently it contains libsetuid.so which can be used to start jetty as root
so that privileged ports may be accessed and then switched to a non-root
user for security.
