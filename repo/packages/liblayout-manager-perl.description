Module for managing layout of graphical components
	
layout::manager is a perl module that provides a framework for working with
layout managers, which are classes that determine the size and position of
arbitrary components within a container. a few managers are provided for
reference purposes, but this module is intended to serve as a basis for other
implementations.

this module uses graphics::primitive::container as a source of its components
(see libgraphics-primitive-perl for details).
