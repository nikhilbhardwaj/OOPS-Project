Low-level virtual machine (llvm), examples
	
the low-level virtual machine (llvm) is a collection of libraries and
tools that make it easy to build compilers, optimizers, just-in-time
code generators, and many other compiler-related programs. llvm
uses a single, language-independent virtual instruction set both
as an offline code representation (to communicate code between
compiler phases and to run-time systems) and as the compiler internal
representation (to analyze and transform programs). this persistent
code representation allows a common set of sophisticated compiler
techniques to be applied at compile-time, link-time, install-time,
run-time, or "idle-time" (between program runs).

this package contains examples for using llvm, both in developing
extensions to llvm and in using it to compile code.
