Library for unicode support and internalisation
	
icu is a mature, widely used set of c/c++ and java libraries for
unicode support, software internationalization and globalization
(i18n/g11n). it grew out of the jdk 1.1 internationalization apis, which
the icu team contributed, and the project continues to be developed
for the most advanced unicode/i18n support. icu is widely portable and
gives applications the same results on all platforms and between c/c++
and java software.
