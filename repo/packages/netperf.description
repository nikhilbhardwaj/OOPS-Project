Network performance benchmark
	
netperf is a benchmark that can be used to measure the performance of many
different types of networking. it provides tests for both unidirecitonal
throughput, and end-to-end latency. the environments currently measureable by
netperf include:

 * tcp and udp via bsd sockets
 * dlpi
 * unix domain sockets
