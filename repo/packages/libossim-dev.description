The ossim library -- development files
	
open source software image map (ossim) is a high performance engine for
remote sensing, image processing, geographical information systems and
photogrammetry. it has been actively developed since 1996.

designed as a series of high performance software libraries, it is
written in c++ employing the latest techniques in object-oriented
software design.

the library provides advanced remote sensing, image processing, and
geo-spatial functionality. a quick summary of ossim functionality
includes ortho-rectification, precision terrain correction, rigorous
sensor models, very large mosaics, and cross sensor fusions, a wide
range of map projections anddatums, and a large range of commercial
and government data formats. the architecture of the library supports
parallel processing with mpi, a dynamic plugin architecture, and
dynamically connectable objects allowing rapid prototyping of custom
image processing chains.

this package includes the development files to build programs
that use the ossim library.
