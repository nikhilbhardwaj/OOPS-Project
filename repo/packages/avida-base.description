Auto-adaptive genetic system for artificial life research
	
avida is an auto-adaptive genetic system designed
primarily for use as a platform in digital or
artificial life research. in lay terms, avida is a
digital world in which simple computer programs
mutate and evolve.

avida allows us to study questions and perform
experiments in evolutionalry dynamics and
theoretical biology that are intractable in real
biological system.
