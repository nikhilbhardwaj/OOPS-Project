General ruby class extensions for datamapper and merb
	
this library provides a number of lightweight ruby class extensions
extracted from datamapper. examples include a mash class, which is a
hash with indifferent access and an added blank? method to most
standard variable classes.

this package is a dependency package, which depends on the package
containing actual ruby extlib libraries for the default ruby version
(currently 1.8).
