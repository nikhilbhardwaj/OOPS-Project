Manipulate x11 keymaps (for xmodmap) graphically
	
xkeycaps is a graphical front-end to xmodmap(1). it opens a window that looks
like a keyboard; moving the mouse over a key shows what keysyms and modifier
bits that key generates. clicking on a key simulates keypress/keyrelease
events on the window of your choice. it is possible to change the keysyms
and modifiers generated by a key through a mouse-based interface. this
program can also write an input file for xmodmap to recreate your changes in
future sessions.
