Find uris which may be wrapped in enclosing delimiters
	
works like uri::find, but is prepared for uris in your text to be
wrapped in a pair of delimiters and optionally have a title. this will
be useful for processing text that already has some minimal markup in
it, like bulletin board posts or wiki text.
