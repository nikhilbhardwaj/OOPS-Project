Gui commit tool
	
qct is a gui enabled commit tool for various vcs (currently mercurial,
bazaar, perforce, subversion, cogito/git, monotone, cvs). it aims to be
cross-platform (linux, windows-native, macos, cygwin). it allows the user
to view diffs, select which files to commit (or ignore / revert), write
commit messages and perform the commit itself.
