Global positioning system - daemon
	
the gpsd service daemon can monitor one or more gps devices connected to
a host computer, making all data on the location and movements of the
sensors available to be queried on tcp port 2947.

with gpsd, multiple gps client applications can share access to devices
without contention or loss of data. also, gpsd responds to queries with a
format that is substantially easier to parse than the different standards
emitted by gps devices.
