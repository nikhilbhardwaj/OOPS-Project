Qt 4 d-bus module
	
qt is a cross-platform c++ application framework. qt's primary feature
is its rich set of widgets that provide standard gui functionality.

the qtdbus module is a unix-only library that you can use to make inter-process
communication using the d-bus protocol.

applications using the qtdbus module can provide services to other, remote
applications by exporting objects, as well as use services exported by those
applications by placing calls and accessing properties.
