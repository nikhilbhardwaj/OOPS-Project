Windowmaker docklet watching your inbox
	
wmail is a window maker docklet watching your inbox, which is either a
ordinary mbox or a directory conforming to qmails maildir format. it
provides a nice little gui displaying some useful pieces of information
about your inbox (as many other nice wm-apps doing nearly the same
thing...). per default it uses the $mail environment-variable to locate
the inbox you are using, other mailing mechanisms like pop or imap are
not supported - use a tool like fetchmail to retrieve pop- or imap-based
mail.
