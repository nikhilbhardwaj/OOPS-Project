A mail notification program designed for windowmaker
	
there's nothing in the program that makes it require windowmaker, except
maybe the look. it's much like xbiff, and was derived from asmail 0.50.
now includes support for a variety of mailboxes, including mbox, mh,
maildir, pop3 and imap. a few pixmaps and sounds are included with the
package.
