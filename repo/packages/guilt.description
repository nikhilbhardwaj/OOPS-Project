Quilt for git; similar to mercurial queues
	
guilt (git quilt) is a series of bash scripts which add a mercurial
queues-like functionality and interface to git.  the one distinguishing
feature from other quilt-like porcelains, is the format of the patches
directory.

all the information is stored as plain text - a series file and the
patches (one per file). this easily lends itself to versioning the patches
using any number of scms.
