Generates large textures from a small sample
	
gimp-texturize is a plug-in for the gimp, a famous picture editor and
manipulator.

a few images are designed to be copy-pasted one next to another and
still look natural, but the result is usually periodic and very
monotonous. the texturize plugin allows you to have a realistic
pseudo-periodicity.

have a look at http://www.manucornet.net/informatique/texturize.php to
see how it looks like.
