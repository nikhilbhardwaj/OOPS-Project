A c++ interface to the gnome xml library (debug symbols)
	
libxml++ is a c++ wrapper for the libxml2 xml parser library (otherwise
known as the gnome xml library).  it has sax and dom-like apis, but does not
attempt to conform exactly to the dom specification because they are not
aimed at c++.  its api is much simpler than the underlying libxml c api.

this package contains debug symbols for debugging applications using libxml++.
