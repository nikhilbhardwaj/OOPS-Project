Additional linear-algebra functions for octave
	
this package provides additional functions to work on linear algebra
code in octave, a numerical computation software. this package
includies general singular value methods to factorize a matrix
(bicg), function to calculate the condition numbers of eigenvalues of
a matrix (condeig), a matrix equivelant of the octave function name
(funm) and trigonometric/hyperbolic functions for square matrixes.

this octave add-on package is part of the octave-forge project.
