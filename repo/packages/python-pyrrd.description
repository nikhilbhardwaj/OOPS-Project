Object-oriented python interface for rrd
	
pyrrd is a module that wraps rrdtool (round-robin database tool) to allow
for the greatest possible programmatic ease in creating, updating, querying
and graphing rrd data. the idea is to make rrdtool insanely easy to use and
to be aesthetically pleasing for python programmers.

it is different from python-rrdtool, which is more a simple way to use
rrdtool as by command line, because python-pyrrd wraps options in objects
that are more easy and comfortable to use.
