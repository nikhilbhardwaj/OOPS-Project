System administration tool to manage gnome desktop settings
	
sabayon provides a sane way to edit gconf defaults and gconf mandatory keys:
the same way you edit your desktop.

sabayon launches profiles in an xnest window. any changes you make in the
xnest window are saved back to the profile file, which can then be applied
to user's accounts.
