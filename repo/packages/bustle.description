D-bus activity visualiser
	
bustle is a tool to chart and provide timing information of d-bus
calls for profiling and debugging purposes. it is intended to replace
reading the cryptic output of dbus-monitor.

calls are displayed using message sequence charts, a succinct way of
representing entities and interactions over time. it can also output
data in graphviz format.
