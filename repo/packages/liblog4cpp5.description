log for c++ is a library of c++ classes for flexible logging to files,
syslog and other destinations. it is modeled after the log for
java library (http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/), staying as close to
their api as is reasonable.

this package contains the files necessary for running applications that
use the log4cpp library.
