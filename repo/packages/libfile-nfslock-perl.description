Perl module to do nfs (or not) locking
	
program based on the concept of hard linking of files being atomic across
nfs. this concept was mentioned in mail::box::locker. some ideas are
taken from there -- particularly the idea of creating a random local file,
hard linking a common file to the local file, and then checking the nlink
status.

file::nfslock was written to be light, generic, and fast.
