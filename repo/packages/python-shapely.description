Geometric objects, predicates, and operations
	
shapely is a package for manipulation and analysis of 2d features.
its capabilities include:

 * calculating the point set unions, intersections, or differences of features
 * predicate tests on features: intersects, touches, contains, and more.


supported geometric types are points, line strings, linear rings, polygons, and
homogeneous or heterogeneous collections thereof.
