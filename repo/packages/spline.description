Akima spline interpolation
	
aspline(1) interpolates an akima-spline through a series of given points.
the akima-spline interpolation approximates a manually drawn curve better
than the ordinary splines, but the second derivative is not continuous.

the akima-spline algorithm is described in "a new method of interpolation and
smooth curve fitting based on local procedures", h. akima, j. assoc. comput.
