Automatic inflation/deflation of epoch-based datetime objects for dbix::class
	
dbix::class::datetime::epoch automatically inflates/deflates datetime objects
from/to epoch values for the specified columns. this module is essentially an
extension to dbix::class::inflatecolumn::datetime so all of the settings,
including "locale" and "timezone", are also valid.

dbix::class::timestamp can also be used in conjunction with this module to
support epoch-based columns that are automatically set on creation of a row
and updated subsequent modifications.
