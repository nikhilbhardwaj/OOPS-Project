A general purpose command-line testing tool
	
atheist allows you to specify the behaviour of your tests in a
declarative way using many predefined structures (such as task,
conditions, daemons, etc.) and provides detailed statistics.

the programmer describes the test behaviour in a .test file and
atheist runs every test found. it is possible to check and prepare
the system by writting setup and teardown files that are executed
after and before each test.
