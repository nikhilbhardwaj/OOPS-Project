Scientific plotting library (development files)
	
plplot is relatively small, portable, freely distributable, and is rich
enough to satisfy most users.  it has a wide range of plot types including
line (linear, log), contour, 3d, fill, and almost 1000 characters
(including greek and mathematical) in its extended font set.  the package
is designed to make it easy to quickly get graphical output; only a
handful of function calls is typically required.  for more advanced use,
virtually all aspects of plotting are configurable.

this package contains all that is needed for doing development in c, c++,
and fortran with plplot.  examples of programs for these languages are
also included.  for development in tcl/tk, python, and octave, install
the plplot-tcl, python-plplot, and octave-plplot packages, respectively.
