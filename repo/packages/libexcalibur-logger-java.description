Excalibur project's log management system
	
excalibur-logger integrates neatly into the avalon ecm and excalibur-fortress.
the main goal is to be able to define the log categories on a component basis
by specifying a 'logger' attribute which denotes the log category to use for
a particular component (given the component is logenabled or loggable).
