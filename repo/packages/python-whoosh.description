Pure-python full-text indexing, search, and spell checking library
	
whoosh is a fast, pure-python indexing and search library. programmers
can use it to easily add search functionality to their applications and
websites. as whoosh is pure python, you don't have to compile or
install a binary support library and/or make python work with a jvm, yet
indexing and searching is still very fast. whoosh is designed to be
modular, so every part can be extended or replaced to meet your needs
exactly.
