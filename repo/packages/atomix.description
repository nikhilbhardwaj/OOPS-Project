Puzzle game for building molecules out of isolated atoms
	
atomix is a game designed for gnome in which you have to build molecules,
from simple inorganic to extremely complex organic ones, out of isolated
atoms.

the first levels can be misleadingly easy, but added complexity always
comes with the next level, so that several minutes (or even much more
than that) can be spent on getting out of one single level.
