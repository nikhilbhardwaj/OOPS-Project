Dock any program into the system tray
	
with alltray you can dock any application with no native tray icon
(like evolution, thunderbird, terminals) into the system tray.
a high-light feature is that a click on the "close" button
will minimize back to system tray. it works well with gnome,
kde, xfce 4*, fluxbox* and windowmaker*.
(*) no drag 'n drop support. enable with "-nm" option.
