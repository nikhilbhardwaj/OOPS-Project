Perl module providing the tk graphics library
	
perl/tk (also known as ptk or ptk) is a collection of modules and
code that attempts to wed the easily configured tk widget toolkit
to the powerful lexigraphic, dynamic memory, i/o, and object-oriented
capabilities of perl 5. in other words, it is an interpreted
scripting language for making widgets and programs with graphical
user interfaces (gui).

a good place to get started is by running the "widget" demo that's
installed with this package.
