Convert images into sounds
	
enscribe converts the scanlines of the input image into frequency components
and then using an inverse fast fourier transform, converts them into sound. the
left side of the image is the low frequency end, and the right is the high end,
up to just under the nyquist limit if you want it to. there are several tunable
parameters as to how colour is converted into stereo sound and the frequency
range to be used. this conversion can be used to create resilient audio
watermarks or to simply create interesting sounds from images.
