Allow idle hard disks to spin down
	
noflushd is a daemon that spins down disks that have not been read from
after a certain amount of time, and then prevents disk writes from
spinning them back up. it's targeted for laptops but can be used on any
computer with ide or sata disks. the effect is that the hard disk actually
spins down, saving you battery power, and shutting off the loudest
component of most computers.
