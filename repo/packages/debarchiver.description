Tool to handle debian package archives
	
this tool can create a potato like file structure that dselect,
apt-get and similar tools can use for easier installation.

you just have to place the package files into a incoming
directory and the tool does the sorting (if you place the
generated '.changes' file there too).

observe! this package will create a cronjob that does the
actual sorting.
