xml::feed is a syndication feed parser for both rss and atom feeds. it
also implements feed auto-discovery for finding feeds, given a uri.

xml::feed supports the following syndication feed formats:


 * rss 0.91

 * rss 2.0
 * atom


the goal of xml::feed is to provide a unified api for parsing and using
the various syndication formats.
