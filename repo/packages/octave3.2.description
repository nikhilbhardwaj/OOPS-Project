Gnu octave language for numerical computations (3.2 branch)
	
octave is a (mostly matlab (r) compatible) high-level language, primarily
intended for numerical computations. it provides a convenient command-line
interface for solving linear and nonlinear problems numerically.

octave uses some of the best and most respected numerical libraries as
balgen, dassl, eispack, fftpack, lapack, linpack, minpack, odepack,
ranlib, slatec-fn and villad. octave can be dynamically extended with
user-supplied c++ files.
