A self-imposed discipline and productivity enforcer
	
lockout is a tool that imposes discipline on you so that you get some work
done.  for example, lockout can be used to install a firewall that does not
let you browse the web.  lockout changes the root password for a specified
duration; this prevents you from secretly ripping down the firewall and then
browsing the web anyway.  in case of an emergency, you can reboot your
computer to undo the effects of lockout and to restore the original root
password.  see also http://thomer.com/lockout/
