A cross-platform makefile tool
	
tmake is an easy-to-use tool from trolltech to create and maintain makefiles
for software projects.  it can be a painful task to manage makefiles
manually, especially if you develop for more than one platform or use more
than one compiler.  tmake automates and streamlines this process and lets you
spend your valuable time on writing code, not makefiles.

tmake is mainly used to generate makefiles for applications that use the qt
toolkit.
