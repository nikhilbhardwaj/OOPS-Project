Automatic classification or clustering
	
multimix fits a mixture of multivariate distributions to a set of
observations by maximum likelihood using the em algorithm.  the
emphasis is less on parameter estimation than on the use of the
estimated component distributions to cluster the data.  the program
is designed to cluster multivariate data with categorical and
continuous variables.
