Create large posters out of postscript pages
	
poster takes a one-page postscript file and scales it to a specified
size.  it can tile the resulting image into multiple smaller pages
that can be pasted together to form the big poster.  poster prefers
eps as its input although freer forms of postscript are also
understood.
