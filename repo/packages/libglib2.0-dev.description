Development files for the glib library
	
glib is a library containing many useful c routines for things such
as trees, hashes, lists, and strings.  it is a useful general-purpose
c library used by projects such as gtk+, gimp, and gnome.

this package is needed to compile programs against libglib2.0-0,
as only it includes the header files and static libraries (optionally)
needed for compiling.
