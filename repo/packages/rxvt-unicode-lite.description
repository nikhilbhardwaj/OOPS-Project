Rxvt-like terminal emulator with basic unicode support
	
rxvt-unicode is a modern, unicode-aware color xterm replacement that uses
significantly less memory than a conventional xterm and many other unicode
supporting terminal emulators.

it supports using multiple fonts at the same time, including xft fonts, and
client-server technology to reduce memory consumption when using multiple
windows.

this package contains the small version with only a few extra features and
without freetype support.
