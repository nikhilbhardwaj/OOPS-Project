Module for building a modern perl interactive shell
	
devel::repl is a module for creating read-evaluate-print-loops (repl) in
perl. the shell provides for rapid development or testing of code without the
need to create a temporary source code file.

through a plugin system, many features are available on demand. you can also
tailor the environment through the use of profiles and run control files, for
example to pre-load certain perl modules when working on a particular
project.
