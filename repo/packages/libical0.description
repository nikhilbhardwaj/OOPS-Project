Icalendar library implementation in c (runtime)
	
libical is an open source implementation of the ietf's icalendar calendaring
and scheduling protocols (rfc 2445, 2446, and 2447). it parses ical components
and provides a c api for manipulating the component properties, parameters,
and subcomponents.

this package contains the files necessary for running applications that use
the libical library.
