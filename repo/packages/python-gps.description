Global positioning system - python libraries
	
the gpsd service daemon can monitor one or more gps devices connected to
a host computer, making all data on the location and movements of the
sensors available to be queried on tcp port 2947.

this package contains a python interface to connect to gpsd, together with
a module providing a controlled testing environment. it also ships two tools
which utilize the interface: gpsprof for latency-profiling, and gpsfake to
simulate a gps by playing back a logfile.
