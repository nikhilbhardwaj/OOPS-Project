Support on-the-fly transparency changing in xorg
	
transset-df is a program that allows the user to change window transparencies
on the fly. supported methods include using window manager hotkeys, 'select
by pointing' without actually shifting focus to the window, and selecting by
name and window id. transset-df is a modified version of xorg's transset and
requires compositing to function. it is meant to allow a window manager
independent way to support transparency.
