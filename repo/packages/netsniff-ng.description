A high performance network sniffer for packet inspection
	
netsniff-ng is a high performance linux network sniffer
for packet inspection. it can be used for protocol analysis
and reverse engineering, network debugging, measurement of
performance throughput or network statistics creation of
incoming packets on central network nodes like routers
or firewalls. it works similar to tcpdump, but a 'zero-copy'
mechanism for network packets results in better performance
than libpcap-based sniffers.
