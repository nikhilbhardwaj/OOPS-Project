Graphical disk usage display with cleanup facilities
	
kdirstat (kde directory statistics) is a small utility program that sums
up disk usage for directory trees, very much like the unix 'du' command.
it displays the disk space used up by a directory tree, both numerically
and graphically.  it is network transparent (i.e., you can use it to sum
up ftp servers), and comes with predefined and user configurable cleanup
actions.  you can directly open a directory branch in konqueror or the
shell of your choice, compress it to a .tar.bz2 archive, or define your
own cleanup actions.
