Shell with c-like syntax, standard login shell on bsd systems
	
the c shell was originally written at ucb to overcome limitations in the
bourne shell.  its flexibility and comfort (at that time) quickly made it
the shell of choice until more advanced shells like ksh, bash, zsh or
tcsh appeared.  most of the latter incorporate features original to csh.

this package is based on current openbsd sources.
