Module to provide metrics of perl code
	
perl::metrics::simple is a perl module that provides several useful methods
for static analysis of one or many perl files. it currently offers these
metrics: packages, subroutines, lines of code, and an approximation of
cyclomatic (mccabe) complexity for the subroutines and the "main" portion
of the code.

this module is designed to be simpler than the similar perl::metric module.
