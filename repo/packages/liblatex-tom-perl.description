A module for parsing, analyzing and manipulating latex documents
	
this module provides a parser which parses and interprets (though not fully)
latex documents and returns a tree-based representation of what it finds.
this tree is a latex::tom::tree. the tree contains latex::tom::node nodes.

this module should be especially useful to anyone who wants to do processing
of latex documents that requires extraction of plain-text information, or
altering of the plain-text components (or alternatively, the math-text
components).
