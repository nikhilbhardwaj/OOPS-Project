Architecture for analyzing software, common files
	
the fossology project is a web based framework that allows you to
upload software to be picked apart and then analyzed by software agents
which produce results that are then browsable via the web interface.
existing agents include license analysis, metadata extraction, and mime
type identification.

this package contains the resources needed by all of the other
fossology components.
