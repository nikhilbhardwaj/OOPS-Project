Elegant c++ unit test framework
	
tut is a unit test framework for c++, written in pure c++. it makes use of
c++ templates to reduce the responsibilities of the user and provide an
intuitive and easy-to-use interface. unlike other test unit frameworks for
c++, tut doesn't use macros, since their usage conceals actual implementation
and (what's worse) can interfere with client application.

tut completely fits into a single header file. no library compilation is
required, thus a lot of portability problems are avoided and integration with
client code is very simple.
