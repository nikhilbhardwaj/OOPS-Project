Asynchronous replication system for postgresql
	
bucardo is an asynchronous postgresql replication system, allowing for both
multi-master and multi-slave operations.

bucardo uses pl/pgsql and pl/perlu triggers to send notification events to a
daemon, which replicates the data modifications, and bucardo provides both
standard and custom conflict resolution methods.
