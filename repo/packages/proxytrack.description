Build http caches using archived websites copied by httrack
	
proxytrack is a simple proxy server aimed to deliver content archived by
httrack sessions. it can aggregate multiple download caches, for direct
use (through any browser) or as an upstream cache slave server.
this proxy can handle http/1.1 proxy connections, and is able to reply to
icpv2 requests for an efficient integration within other cache servers,
such as squid. it can also handle transparent http requests to allow
cached live connections inside an offline network.
