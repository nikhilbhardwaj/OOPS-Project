Java library to generate mock objects for given interfaces (documentation)
	
easymock 2 is a library that provides an easy way to use mock objects for given
interfaces. mock objects simulate parts of the behavior of domain code,
and are able to check whether they are used as defined.
domain classes can be tested in isolation
by simulating their collaborators with mock objects.

this package contains the documentation for the mock objects library.
