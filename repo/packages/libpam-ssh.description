Authenticate using ssh keys
	
this pluggable authentication module (pam) provides single sign-on
using secure shell (ssh) keys.  during authentication, the user types
a ssh passphrase and is authenticated if the passphrase successfully
decrypts the user's ssh private keys.  in the pam session phase, an
ssh-agent process is started and decrypted keys are added, and thus
the user can ssh to other hosts that accept key authentication
without typing more passwords for the entire session.
