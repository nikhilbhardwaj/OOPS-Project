Mobile robot programming toolkit - all the libraries
	
the mobile robot programming toolkit (mrpt) is an extensive, cross-platform,
and open source c++ library aimed to help robotics researchers to design and
implement algorithms in the fields of simultaneous localization and mapping
(slam), computer vision, and motion planning (obstacle avoidance).

this virtual package depends on all mrpt libraries.
