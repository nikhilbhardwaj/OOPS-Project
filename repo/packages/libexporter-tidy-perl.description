Another way of exporting symbols
	
exporter::tidy serves as an easy, clean alternative to
exporter. unlike exporter, it is not subclassed, but it simply
exports a custom import() into your namespace.

with exporter::tidy, you don't need to use any package global
in your module. even the subs you export can be lexically scoped.
