Kerberos kinit supporting afs and ticket refreshing
	
k5start can be used instead of kinit to obtain kerberos tickets.  krenew
can be used instead of kinit -r to renew renewable tickets.  they are
intended primarily for use with automated or long-running processes and
support some additional features useful for that purpose, such as running
as a daemon and refreshing the ticket periodically, checking to see if an
existing ticket has expired, or obtaining an afs token along with the
ticket by running an external program automatically.
