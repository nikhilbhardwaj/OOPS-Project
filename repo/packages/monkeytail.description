Tail variant designed for web developers monitoring logfiles
	
monkeytail allows a user to tail multiple files on both local and remote hosts
and clearly marks inactivity by putting 5 newlines in the output whenever a
pause in output over 3 seconds is detected.

monkeytail is implemented a fairly simple wrapper script around standard tail,
ssh, and sudo.
