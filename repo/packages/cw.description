Command-line frontend to unixcw
	
this package contains a simple command line client called cw, which sounds
characters as morse code on the console speaker. the included cwgen binary
can generate groups of random characters for morse code practice.

included are some examples files with embedded commands. these commands can
be used to change speed, tone, spacing between characters and much more.
