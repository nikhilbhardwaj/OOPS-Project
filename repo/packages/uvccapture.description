Usb uvc video class snapshot software
	
the purpose of this software is to capture an image from a usb webcam at a
specified interval, and save it to a jpeg file, no other formats are supported.

right now this software is really a hack, since still image support is not yet
available in the uvc driver. the program continually polls the uvc driver in
mjpeg mode, and at a specified interval writes a jpeg header and a single frame
to file, creating a jpeg image.
