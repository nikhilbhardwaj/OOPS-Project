Transitional dummy package for email::simple::creator
	
email::simple is the first deliverable of the perl email project, a reaction
against the complexity and increasing bugginess of the mail::* modules. in
contrast, email::* modules are meant to be simple to use and to maintain,
pared to the bone, fast, minimal in their external dependencies, and correct.

this is a transitional dummy package which can be safely removed after the
upgrade. the email::simple::creator module is now part of email::simple.
