Modules providing common scalar and list utility subroutines
	
list::util is a collection of perl modules that provide subroutines useful
for working with scalars and lists, which people have expressed would be nice
to have as a perl builtin, but where usage would not be sufficient to warrant
use of a keyword, and the size so small such that being individual extensions
would be wasteful.
