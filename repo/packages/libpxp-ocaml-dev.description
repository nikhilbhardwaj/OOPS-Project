Ocaml library that implements an xml-1.0 validating parser
	
pxp is a validating parser for xml-1.0 which has been written entirely
in objective caml.

pxp is the new name of the parser formerly known as "markup". pxp means
"polymorphic xml parser" and emphasizes its most useful property: that
the api is polymorphic and can be configured such that different objects
are used to store different types of elements.
