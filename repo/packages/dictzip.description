Compression utility for dictionary databases
	
this package provides a utility to compress dictionary databases with the
lz77 algorithm in a manner which is completely compatible with gzip(1),
but using an extension that allows for random access to chunks
of about 57kb without the overhead of decompressing the entire file.

this package also includes dictunzip, to decompress dictzipped files,
and dictzcat, for viewing dictzipped files.
