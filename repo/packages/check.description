Unit test framework for c
	
check features a simple interface for defining unit tests, putting
little in the way of the developer. tests are run in a separate
address space, so check can catch both assertion failures and code
errors that cause segmentation faults or other signals. the output
from unit tests can be used within source code editors and ides.
