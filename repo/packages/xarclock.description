Reversed xclock
	
if clocks had been invented in argentina (southern hemisphere), they
would run counter-clockwise. down there a sundial runs the other way
around!

the program is an extension of the standard x clock widget.  new
features are: configurable direction of rotation and font support in
analog mode.
