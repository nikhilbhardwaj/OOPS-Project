Debhelper script to help packaging kernel patches
	
the dh_installkpatches script produces the "apply" and "unpatch" scripts
that kernel-package uses to automatically handle kernel patches.  it
provides a number of useful features like:

 * does its best to never break your kernel source tree
 * allows you to select any provided version of a patch
 * handle patch inter-dependencies


patches are described in a debian-standard control-file-like format.
