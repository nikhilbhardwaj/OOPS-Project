A virtual lens design workshop
	
opticalraytracer is an application that analyzes systems of
lenses. it uses optical principles and a virtual optical bench
to predict the behavior of many kinds of ordinary and exotic lens
types. opticalraytracer includes an advanced, easy-to-use interface
that allows the user to rearrange the optical configuration by simply
dragging lenses around using the mouse.
