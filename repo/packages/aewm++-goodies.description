Utilities to complement a minimal window manager
	
these utilities were previously supplied with aewm++; they are intended
to provide some of the typical desktop functionality that aewm++ itself
does not include. this package provides:

 * aewm++_appbar: a small application launcher
 * aewm++_fspanel: a very small panel
 * aewm++_setrootimage: draws a gradient on the x root window
 * aewm++_xsession: keeps an x session alive

note that some of these were named differently in previous releases.
