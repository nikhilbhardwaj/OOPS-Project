Shows the tracks on a cd as normal files
	
cdfs is a file system for linux systems that `exports' all tracks and
boot images on a cd as normal files.  these files can then be mounted
(e.g. for iso and boot images), copied, played (wave audio and videocd
tracks)... the primary goal for developing this file system was to
`unlock' information in old iso images.
