the smartmontools package contains two utility programs (smartctl and smartd)
to control and monitor storage systems using the self-monitoring, analysis and
reporting technology system (s.m.a.r.t.) built into most modern ata and scsi
hard disks. it is derived from the smartsuite package, and includes support
for ata/atapi-5 disks. it should run on any modern linux system.
