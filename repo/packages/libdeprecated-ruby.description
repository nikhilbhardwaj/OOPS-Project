Library for handling deprecated code in ruby
	
deprecated is a small library intended to aid developers working with
deprecated code. the idea comes from the 'd' programming language, where
developers can mark certain code as deprecated, and then allow/disallow the
ability to execute deprecated code.

this package is a dependency package, which depends on the package containing
actual deprecated library for the default ruby version (currently 1.8).
