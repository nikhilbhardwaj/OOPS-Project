Network management framework daemon - debugging symbols
	
networkmanager attempts to keep an active network connection available at all
times. it is intended only for the desktop use-case, and is not intended for
usage on servers. the point of networkmanager is to make networking
configuration and setup as painless and automatic as possible.  if using dhcp,
networkmanager is _intended_ to replace default routes, obtain ip addresses
from a dhcp server, and change nameservers whenever it sees fit.

this package contains detached debugging symbols.
