100% pure-java implementation of ruby
	
jruby is a 100% pure-java implementation of the ruby programming language.

jruby provides a complete set of core "builtin" classes and syntax
for the ruby language, as well as most of the ruby standard
libraries. the standard libraries are mostly ruby's own complement of
".rb" files, but a few that depend on c language-based extensions have
been reimplemented. some are still missing, but jruby hopes to
implement as many as is feasible.
