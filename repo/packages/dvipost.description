Post processor for dvi files supporting change bars
	
dvipost is a post processor for dvi files, created by latex or tex.
if the command is invoked as pplatex, it integrates the call of latex
and the post processing of the dvi file.

dvipost is used for special modes, which normally need the support of
dvi drivers (such as dvips). with dvipost, these features could be implemented
independent of the preferred driver. currently, the post processor supports
layout raster, change bars and overstrike mode.
