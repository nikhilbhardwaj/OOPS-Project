Perl module implementing ciphersaber encryption
	
the crypt::ciphersaber module implements ciphersaber encryption,
described at http://ciphersaber.gurus.com.  it is simple, fairly
speedy, and relatively secure algorithm based on rc4.

encryption and decryption are done based on a secret key, which
must be shared with all intended recipients of a message.
