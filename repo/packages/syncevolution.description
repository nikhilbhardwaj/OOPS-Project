Evolution data synchronization program using syncml
	
syncevolution synchronizes evolution's contact, calendar and task
items via syncml. the items are exchanged in the vcard 2.1 or 3.0
format and icalender 2.0 format via the synthesis c++ client api
library, which should make syncevolution compatible with the majority
of syncml servers. full, one-way and incremental synchronization of
items are supported.
