Thin compatibility layer for gray streams
	
this system provides an extremely thin compatibility layer
for gray streams.  it is nearly *too* trivial for a
complete package, except that the author has copy&pasted this
code into enough projects now that the author decided to factor
it out once again now, and then *never* have
to touch it again.
