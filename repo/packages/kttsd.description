A text-to-speech system for kde
	
the kde text-to-speech system is a plugin based service that allows any kde
(or non-kde) application to speak using the d-bus interface.

it uses the speech-dispatcher daemon for the actual speech job; kmouth is an
useful front-end for it.

this package is part of kde accessibility module.
