Path::class type library for moose
	
moosex::types::path::class creates common moose types, coercions and option
specifications useful for dealing with path::class objects as moose
attributes.

coercions (see moose::util::typeconstraints) are made from both 'str' and
'arrayref' to both path::class::dir and path::class::file objects. if you
have moosex::getopt installed, the getopt option type ("=s") will be added
for both path::class::dir and path::class::file.
