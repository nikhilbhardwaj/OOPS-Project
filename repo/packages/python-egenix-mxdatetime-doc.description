Date and time handling routines for python (documentation)
	
mxdatetime is a python extension package that provides three new
objects, datetime, datetimedelta and relativedatetime, which let you
store and handle date/time values in a much more natural way than by
using ticks (seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 utc), the representation
used by python's time module).

the package includes documentation for mxdatetime.
