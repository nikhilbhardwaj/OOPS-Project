The haskell logging framework, ghc package
	
hslogger is a logging framework for haskell, roughly similar to
python's logging module.

hslogger lets each log message have a priority and source be associated
with it.  the programmer can then define global handlers that route
or filter messages based on the priority and source.  hslogger also
has a syslog handler built in.
