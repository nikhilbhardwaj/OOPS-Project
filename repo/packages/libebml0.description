Access library for the ebml format
	
the libebml library allows to read and write files using ebml (the
extensible binary meta language), a binary pendant to xml. using libebml
makes it easier to extend a file format without breaking support in
older parsers.

this package contains the shared library needed to run applications that
use libebml.
