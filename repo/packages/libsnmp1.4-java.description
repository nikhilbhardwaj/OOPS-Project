Open source implementation of the snmp protocol in java
	
the java snmp package provides support for basic snmp client and agent
operations as defined in snmp versions 1 and 2 (excluding the security model
proposed as part of snmp version 2, which was never widely accept or
deployed). the package provides a mechanism for "getting and setting" snmp
object identifier (oid) values through a simple communication interface, and
represents snmp structures and datatypes as corresponding java objects.
