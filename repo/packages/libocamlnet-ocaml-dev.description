Ocaml application-level internet libraries - core development libraries
	
ocamlnet is a collection of ocaml libraries focusing focus on
application-level internet protocols and conventions.

ocamlnet consists of the following libraries:

 * netstring: processing of strings that occur in network context
 * netcgi1 and netcgi2: portable web applications
 * nethttpd: is a web server component (http server implementation)
 * netplex: generic server framework
 * rpc: oncrpc implementation
 * netclient: clients for http, ftp, and telnet
 * equeue: event queue used for many protocol implementations
 * shell: external commands invocation
 * netshm: shared memory for ipc purposes
 * netsys: bindings for system functions
 * smtp and pop: two further client implementations


a number of ideas and concepts are used throughout the libraries:

 * netchannels are a way to abstract sequential i/o channels
 * event queues provided by equeue and unixqueue make asynchronous
   protocol interpreters possible


this package contains the development stuff you need to use the core
ocamlnet libraries in your programs. the following libraries are
packaged separately: ssl-related libraries (libocamlnet-ssl-ocaml-dev),
gtk-related libraries (libocamlnet-gtk2-ocaml-dev), nethttpd
(libnethttpd-ocaml-dev). the netcgi2 apache connector is also part of
this package; to run applications built for that connector you will
need the mod_netcgi_apache apache module (libapache2-mod-ocamlnet).
