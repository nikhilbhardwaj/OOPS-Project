Development files for libgdome2
	
gdome2 is a fast, light and complete dom level2 implementation based
on libxml2.  although it has been written for the gnome project, it
can be used stand-alone.

dom (document object model) is a standard interface for manipulating
xml documents. a dom implementation (also called a host implementation)
is what makes a parsed xml or html document available for processing
using a dom interface.

libgdome2 currently supports the "core", "xml", "events" and
"mutationevents" modules from the dom2 recommendation.

this package contains the header files and static libraries for
developing with libgdome2-0.
