Recursively compute hashsums or piecewise hashings
	
md5deep is a set of tools to compute md5, sha-1, sha-256, tiger, whirlpool
hashsums of arbitrary number of files recursively.

it can also compare those hashsums with a list of known hashes. the tools can
display those that match the list or those that does not match. it can display
a time estimation when processing large files. it can do piecewise hashing
(hashing input files in arbitrary sized blocks).
