Geoip database for tor
	
this package provides a geoip database for tor, i.e. it maps ipv4 addresses
to countries.

bridges (special tor relays that aren't listed in the main tor directory) use
this information to report which countries they get access from.  this allows
the tor network operators to learn if certain countries started blocking
access to bridges.
