Moose extension to delay errors for attribute declarations
	
moosex::lazyrequire adds a lazy_require option to moose attribute
declarations.

the reader methods for all attributes with that option will throw an
exception unless a value for the attributes was provided earlier by a
constructor parameter or through a writer method.
