Shoreline firewall, netfilter configurator - transition package
	
shorewall allows firewall/gateway requirements to be described using
entries in a set of configuration files. it reads those configuration
files and, with the help of the iptables utility, configures
netfilter to match these requirements.

shorewall supports a wide range of router/firewall/gateway applications,
traffic shaping and almost every type of vpn.

this is a transition package and can be safely removed.
