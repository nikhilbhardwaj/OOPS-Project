Terminal-based chinese automatic encoding converter
	
yyt is a pseudo-tty program that converts chinese terminal output
encoded in gb/big5 to a preset encoding automatically. it is
useful for users who have to work with multiple chinese encoding
in console applications. now it also converts input to the incoming
encoding if the incoming encoding is set explicitly.
