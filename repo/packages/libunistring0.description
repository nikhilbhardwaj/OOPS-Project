Unicode string library for c
	
the 'libunistring' library implements unicode strings (in the utf-8,
utf-16, and utf-32 encodings), together with functions for unicode
characters (character names, classifications, properties) and
functions for string processing (formatted output, width, word
breaks, line breaks, normalization, case folding, regular
expressions).

this package contains the shared library.
