Object-oriented and function interface to standard unix files
	
the passwd::unix module provides an abstract interface to /etc/passwd,
/etc/shadow and /etc/group format files. it is inspired by unix::passwdfile
module (that one does not handle /etc/shadow file, what is necessary in
modern systems like sun solaris 10 or linux).
