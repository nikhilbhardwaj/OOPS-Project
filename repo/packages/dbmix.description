Dj mixer for digital audio streams
	
the dbmix software collection mimicks a mixing desk as used by disc jockeys.
using only a single sound card, it allows to mix audio streams from a variety
of sources, cross-fade between them, adjust the pitches, or punch in short
effects.  optionally, a second sound card (or output channel) can be used to
cue in songs.
