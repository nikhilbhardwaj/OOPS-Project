Library for cryptographic hashing and message authentication
	
mhash is a library that provides a uniform interface to a large
number of hash algorithms.  these algorithms can be used to compute
checksums, message digests, and other signatures.  the hmac support
implements the basics for message authentication, following rfc 2104.
mhash also provides several key-generation algorithms, including
those of openpgp (rfc 2440).  further information is available at
http://mhash.sourceforge.net/.

this package contains header files, the man page, and the static
library.
