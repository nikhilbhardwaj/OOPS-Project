Gstreamer based command line media player
	
the program gst123 is designed to be a more flexible command line player in
the spirit of ogg123 and mpg123, based on gstreamer. it plays all file formats
supported by gstreamer, so if you have audio/video collections which contain
different file formats, like flac, ogg and mp3, you can use gst123 to play all
your audio/video files.
