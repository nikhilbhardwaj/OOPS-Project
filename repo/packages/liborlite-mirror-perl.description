Orlite extension to use remote sqlite databases
	
orlite::mirror provides a simple mechanism for opening a read-only sqlite
database from anywhere on the web. in a method analogous to using orlite to
work with a local read-only sqlite database, you can use orlite::mirror to
open a sqlite database at an arbitrary uri. if the remote file has a "gz" or
"bz2" extension, then orlite::mirror will decompress the file before opening.
