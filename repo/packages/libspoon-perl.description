A spiffy application building framework
	
spoon is an application framework that is designed primarily for
building social software web applications. the kwiki wiki software is
built on top of spoon.

spoon::base is the primary base class for all the spoon::* modules.
spoon.pm inherits from spiffy.pm.

spoon is not an application in and of itself. (as compared to kwiki)
you need to build your own applications from it.
