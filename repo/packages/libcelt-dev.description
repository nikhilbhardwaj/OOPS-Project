The celt codec library development files
	
celt is an experimental audio codec for use in low-delay communication.

celt stands for "code-excited lapped transform". it applies some of the celp
principles, but does everything in the frequency domain, which removes some of
the limitations of celp. celt is suitable for both speech and music and
currently features:


 * ultra-low latency (typically from 3 to 9 ms)
 * full audio bandwidth (44.1 khz and 48 khz)
 * stereo support
 * packet loss concealment
 * constant bit-rates from 32 kbps to 128 kbps and above
 * a fixed-point version of the encoder and decoder


the celt codec is meant to close the gap between vorbis and speex for
applications where both high quality audio and low delay are desired.

this package provides the celt library headers and development files.
