d-bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and corba in
terms of complexity.

this package contains the dbus-launch utility which is necessary for
packages using a d-bus session bus.

see the dbus description for more information about d-bus in general.
