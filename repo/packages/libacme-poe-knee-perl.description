Time sliced pony race using the poe event loop
	
poe::knee is a homophone of "pony".  we all like ponies. and wouldn't we
love to race ponies? well, that's what acme::poe::knee is for!

using the poe event driven component architecture, you specify a distance the
ponies must run, and a maximum delay before the pony will reach the next
step. so, the bigger the delay, the bigger the distance between multiple
ponies can be.
