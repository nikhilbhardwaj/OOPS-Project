Job execution engine for torque batch system
	
the torque server dispatches jobs across physically separated
machines. it may also be beneficial for single machines to organise
the sequential execution of multiple jobs.

the pbs_mom daemon is executed on those machines that perform
the computations. this package should be installed on all these
execute hosts. the mom, the client and the server can all be
installed on the same machine.
