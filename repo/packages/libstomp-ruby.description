Ruby bindings for the stomp messaging protocol
	
stomp is a text-oriented wire protocol for messaging (mom/mq/jms)
type systems. this library provides two useful interfaces, a low-
level class, stomp::connection, which is a basic protocol
implementation, and stomp::client, which is designed as a higher
level convenience api.

this package is a dependency package, which depends on the package
containing actual ruby stomp libraries for the default ruby version
(currently 1.8).
