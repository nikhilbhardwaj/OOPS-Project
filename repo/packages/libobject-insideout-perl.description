Comprehensive inside-out object construction kit
	
object::insideout is a perl module that implements inside-out objects as
anonymous scalar references that are blessed into a class with the scalar
containing the id for the object (usually a sequence number). the scalar
reference is set as read-only to prevent accidental modifications to the id.
object data (such as fields) are stored within the class's package in either
arrays indexed by the object's id, or hashes keyed to the object's id.
