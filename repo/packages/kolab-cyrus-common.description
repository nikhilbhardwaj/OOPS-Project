Kolab cyrus mail system - common files
	
cyrus is an imap server designed to handle massive quantities of mail,
with a number of features not found in other imap implementations,
including support for:

 - running the daemon without root privileges;
 - pop3 in addition to plain imap;
 - pop/imap-before-smtp using drac;
 - secure imap using ssl;
 - server-side filtering with sieve;
 - mail users without login accounts;
 - simple mail quotas;
 - virtual domains;
 - ipv6.


cyrus doesn't support reading from and storing mail in the
standard mail spool. it stores mail in a separate directory in its
own mh-like format.

this package contains the common files needed by the other cyrus
components. the kolab-cyrus-imapd and/or kolab-cyrus-pop3d packages are needed
to enable imap and pop3 support respectively.
