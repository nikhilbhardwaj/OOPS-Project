Optimization of large scale problems for the yorick language
	
optimpack is a portable c library which implements algorithms for
optimization of large scale problems with bound constraints. large
scale means some million variables (e.g. pixel values) or more.

the most important algorithm is vmlm-b: a variable metric method with
limited memory requirements and, possibly, bound constraints on the
parameters. the algorithm is based on limited memory bfgs updates
with mor√© & thuente inexact line search and gradient projection to
account for bounds.

this package contains a yorick plug-in based on optimpack.
