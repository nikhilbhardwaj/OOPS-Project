Advanced html to text converter
	
html2text is a converter from html to plain text.

html2text reads html documents supplied in the command line (or from standard
input), converts each of them into a stream of plain text characters and
writes output to the file or the terminal.

debian version also can recognize encoding of documents, do on-fly
input and output recoding.

html2text was written because the author wasn't happy with the
output of "lynx -dump" and so he wrote something better.
