Simple tied hash interface for files and data structures
	
anydata provides simple and uniform access to data from
many sources -- perl arrays, local files, remote files retrievable via
http or ftp -- and in many formats including flat files (csv, fixed
length, tab delimited, etc), standard format files (web logs,
passwd files, etc.),  structured files (xml, html tables) and binary
files with parseable headers (mp3s, jpgs, pngs, etc).
