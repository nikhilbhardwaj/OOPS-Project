Coin-or solver for mixed-integer linear programs
	
symphony is an open-source generic mixed-integer linear programs (milp) solver,
callable library, and extensible framework for implementing customized solvers
symphony has a number of advanced capabilities, including the ability to
solve multi-objective milps, the ability to warm start its solution procedure,
and the ability to perform basic sensitivity analyses.

symphony is part of the larger coin-or initiative (computational infrastructure
for operations research).

this package contains the header files for developers.
