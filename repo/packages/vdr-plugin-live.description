Web administration plugin for vdr
	
live, the "live interactive vdr environment", is a plugin providing the
possibility to interactively control the linux video disc recorder vdr and
some of it's plugins from a web interface.

unlike external programs, like the vdr web frontend "vdradmin-am", that
communicate  with vdr via its svdrp socket interface, live has direct
access to vdr's data structures and thus is very fast.
