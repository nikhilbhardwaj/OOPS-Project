Displays bandwidth usage information on an network interface (debug)
	
iftop does for network usage what top(1) does for cpu usage. it listens to
network traffic on a named interface and displays a table of current bandwidth
usage by pairs of hosts. handy for answering the question "why is my internet
link so slow?".

this package contains the debugging symbols.
