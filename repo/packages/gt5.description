Shell program to display visual disk usage with navigation
	
years have passed and disks have become larger and larger, but even on
this incredibly huge harddisk era, the space seems to disappear over
time. this small and effective programs provides more convenient
listing than the default du(1). it displays what has happened since
last run and displays dir size and the total percentage. it is
possible to navigate and ascend to directories by using cursor-keys
with text based browser (links, elinks, lynx etc.)
