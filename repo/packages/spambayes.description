Python-based spam filter using statistical analysis
	
spambayes uses a different set of algorithm to most statistical spam
filters, which enables to dramatically lower the number of legitimate
mail classified as spam, through the introduction of an 'unsure'
category.

spambayes can be used as a pop3 or an imap proxy, as well as a simple
mail filter for use with procmail.
