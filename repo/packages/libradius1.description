/bin/login replacement with radius. shared lib to used by programs
	
radiusclient is a /bin/login replacement  which gets called by a getty
to log  in a user and  to setup the user's  login environment.  normal
login programs just  check the login name and  password which the user
entered against the local password file (/etc/passwd, /etc/shadow). in
contrast  to  that  radiusclient  also  uses the  radius  protocol  to
authenticate the user.

this is the libraries needed by any client needing the radius protocol.
