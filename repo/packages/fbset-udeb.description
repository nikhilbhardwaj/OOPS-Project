Framebuffer device maintenance program
	
program to modify settings for the framebuffer devices (/dev/fb[0-9]*
or /dev/fb/[0-9]*) on linux, like depth, virtual resolution, timing
parameters etc.

this contains the udeb, which is used for the debian-installer
installation system. it won't work well on a normal debian system.
