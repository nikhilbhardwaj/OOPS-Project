Qt4 gui component toolkit for inventor - development
	
soqt is a qt gui component toolkit library for coin, based on the
api of the inventorxt gui component toolkit.  soqt is also compatible
with openinventor of sgi and tgs.

soqt provides a class-hierarchy of viewer classes that ranges from a
simple render canvas (the soqtrenderarea), providing only the basic
synchronization and device input conversion routines between qt and
coin, up to 3 different full-featured viewer classes
(soqtexaminerviewer, soqtplaneviewer and soqtflyviewer) with input
device handling logic and user interfaces to let the application
programmer do rapid application development.

this library is linked against qt version 4.
