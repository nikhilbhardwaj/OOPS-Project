Printing tool for cups on the gnome desktop
	
gtklp lets you print files under the common unix printing system
(cups).  written in gtk+ 2.0 and for the gnome desktop environment,
it supports multiple option settings for each printer it knows,
with all the standard cups options available.

other features include localized dialogs for several languages, as
well as multiple interfaces; with a little more effort, you can use
gtklp as a drop-in replacement for `lp'.
