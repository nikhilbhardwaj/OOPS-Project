Linux fdisk replacement based on libparted
	
gnu fdisk is a replacement to the old linux fdisk. it provides the same
features as the original fdisk provides plus some interesting ones like:

 * partition resizing
 * creating filesystem on newly created partitions
 * partition integrity checking
 * copying/moving partition


gnu fdisk also intend to be a valid replacement for mac-fdisk and freebsd
fdisk.
