The gnu bc arbitrary precision calculator language
	
gnu bc is an interactive algebraic language with arbitrary precision which
follows the posix 1003.2 draft standard, with several extensions including
multi-character variable names, an `else' statement and full boolean
expressions.  gnu bc does not require the separate gnu dc program.
