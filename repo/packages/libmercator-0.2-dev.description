Worldforge terrain library - development files
	
mercator is primarily aimed at terrain for multiplayer online games and
forms one of the worldforge core libraries.
it is intended to be used as a terrain library on the client, while a
subset of features are useful on the server.

mercator is designed in such a way that individual tiles can be
generated on-the-fly from a very small source data set.  each tile uses
a fast deterministic random number generation to ensure that identical
results are produced "anytime, anywhere".  this enables transmission of
terrain across low bandwidth links as part of the standard data stream,
or server side collision detection with the same terrain that the
player sees.

the use of tiles means that there is inherently a large degree of gross
control of the shape of the terrain.  finer control is implemented by
allowing geometric modifications - for example, a polygonal area might
be flattened, or a crater could be applied.
