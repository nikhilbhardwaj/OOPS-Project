Interface to libdumbnet's low-level network functions
	
net::libdnet is a perl module that provides a simple and portable interface
to many useful low-level networking routines. its functionality includes
network address manipulation, kernel arp cache and route table manipulation,
firewalling, network interface manipulation, network traffic interception via
tunnel interfaces, and raw ip packet/ethernet frame transmission.

this module is intended to complement functionality provided by libpcap. for
historical reasons, dug song's libdnet is called libdumbnet on debian.
