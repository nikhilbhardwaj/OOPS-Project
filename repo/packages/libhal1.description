Hardware abstraction layer - shared library
	
hal provides an abstract view on hardware.

this abstraction layer is simply an interface that makes it possible to
add support for new devices and new ways of connecting devices to the
computer, without modifying every application that uses the device.
it maintains a list of devices that currently exist, and can provide
information about those upon request.

this package contains shared libraries to be used by applications.
