A c++ source scanning build utility
	
scan the source for main functions and includes. when the file
contains a main function it will compile all the files next to that
file's includes and link them into a program.

this makes it possible to build entire programs with minimal
configuration. linker and compiler options can be added and will be
automatically divided over the compiler and linker.
