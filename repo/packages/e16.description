The enlightenment window manager dr16
	
e16 is a window manager for the x window system that is designed
to be powerful, extensible, configurable and pretty darned good
looking! it is one of the more graphically intense window managers.

e16 goes beyond managing windows by providing a useful and
appealing graphical shell from which to work. it is open in design
and instead of dictating a policy, allows the user to define their
own policy, down to every last detail.
