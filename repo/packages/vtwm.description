Virtual tab window manager
	
vtwm is an enhanced version of the tab window manager (twm) that adds many
features -- primarily a virtual desktop, meaning that what is currently on
screen is just a portion of a larger workspace.  what portion of the virtual
desktop that is displayed, and whatever windows might be visible within it,
are simple point-and-click operations within a scaled representation of the
workspace.
