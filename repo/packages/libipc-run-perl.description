Perl module for running processes
	
ipc::run allows you to run and interact with child processes using
files, pipes, and pseudo-ttys.  both system()-style and scripted
usages are supported and may be mixed.  likewise, functional and oo
api styles are both supported and may be mixed.

various redirection operators reminiscent of those seen on common
unix and dos command lines are provided.
