Tiny abstract black and white 2d cave-shooter
	
this is a small, abstract shooting game from japanese developer kuni.
it is a 'caveflier' in which the exhaust from the engine serves also as
a tool to erode the cave walls.

your goal is to fly upwards as long as you possibly can, without
crashing against the cave walls and the window borders.
