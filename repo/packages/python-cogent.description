Framework for genomic biology
	
pycogent is a software library for genomic biology. it is a fully
integrated and thoroughly tested framework for: controlling third-party
applications; devising workflows; querying databases; conducting novel
probabilistic analyses of biological sequence evolution; and generating
publication quality graphics. it is distinguished by many unique built-in
capabilities (such as true codon alignment) and the frequent addition
of entirely new methods for the analysis of genomic data.
