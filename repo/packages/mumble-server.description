Low latency voip server
	
murmur is the voip server component for mumble. murmur is installed
in a system-wide fashion, but can also be run by individual users.
each murmur process supports multiple virtual servers, each with their
own user base and channel list. administration of murmur is done through
d-bus. example scripts which register new users and list connected users
through a web page are can be found in the package 'mumble-server-web'.
