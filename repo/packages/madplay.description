Mpeg audio player in fixed point
	
mad is an mpeg audio decoder. it currently only supports the mpeg 1
standard, but fully implements all three audio layers (layer i, layer ii,
and layer iii, the latter often colloquially known as mp3.).  there is also
full support for id3 tags.

all work is done in fixed point, so it even works on machines without an fpu.
