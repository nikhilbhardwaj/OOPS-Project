Emulates a cisco style telnet command-line interface (dev files)
	
libcli provides a consistant cisco style command-line environment for
remote clients, with a few common features between every implemtation.

the library is not accessed by itself, rather the software which uses
it listens on a defined port for a telnet connection. this connection
is handed off to libcli for processing.

libcli includes support for command history, command line editing and
filtering of command output.

this package contains the files necessary for developing applications
with libcli.
