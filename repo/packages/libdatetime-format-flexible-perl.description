Perl module to transform strings into datetime objects
	
datetime::format::flexible is designed to transform arbitrary date/time
strings into datetime objects. it is currently able to parse and extract date
information from over 2500 variations of date/time strings.

although this module is similar in nature to datetime::format::natural (see
libdatetime-format-natural-perl), it currently fails to parse more than 2000
of the formats successfully parsed by this module.
