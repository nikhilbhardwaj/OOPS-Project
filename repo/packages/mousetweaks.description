Mouse accessibility enhancements for the gnome desktop
	
this package contains a daemon and some panel applets to improve mouse
usability on the gnome desktop. these enhancements are:


   * the possibility to click without a button
   * the ability to bring the context menu with a one-button mouse
     (like macos does)
   * an area to capture the mouse pointer until it is released with a
     pre-defined key combination.
