A minimalist window manager for x11
	
aewm is a minimalist window manager for x11. it has no nifty
features, but is light on resources and extremely simple in
appearance. it should eventually make a good reference implementation
of the icccm. a few separate programs are included to handle running
programs, switching between windows, etc.
