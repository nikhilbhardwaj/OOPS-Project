Make objects with circular references destroy normally
	
object::destroyer allows for the creation of "destroy" handles. the
handle is "attached" to a circular relationship, but is not a part of
it. when the destroy handle falls out of scope, it will be cleaned up
correctly, and while being cleaned up, it will also force the data
structure it is attached to to be destroyed as well. object::destroyer
can call a specified release method on an object (or method destroy by
default). alternatively, it can execute an arbitrary user code passed to
constructor as a code reference.
