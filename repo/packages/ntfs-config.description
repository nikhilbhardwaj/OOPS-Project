Enable/disable write support for any ntfs devices
	
this program allow you to easily configure all of your ntfs devices
to allow write support via a friendly gui.
for that use, it will configure them to use the open source ntfs-3g
driver. you'll also be able to easily disable this feature.

it just so happens that this program is a newer and improved version,
but very few people know about it. it's better to install the
disk-manager.
