Advanced lightweight configurable editor
	
efte is an advanced programmers editor with goals of being lightweight, yet
totally configurable.  support for user defined programming languages, menu
systems and key bindings are provided with many common defaults already
defined.

efte is still a new project, however, extended from the fte editor which was
first released in 1995, so efte is tried and true with many features for the
programmer/text editor.
