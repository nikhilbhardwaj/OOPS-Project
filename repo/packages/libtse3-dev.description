Portable midi sequencer engine in c++ - development files
	
tse3 is a portable open source midi sequencer engine written in c++.
it provides programmers with rich and powerful sequencing
capabilities.  although it does not provide a user interface, it
provides a lot of assistance to a ui, attempting to provide as much
functionality as possible in as generic a manner as possible.

this package provides the headers and static libraries that are
needed to compile something that uses tse3. it is not required to run
programs that are linked against tse3.
