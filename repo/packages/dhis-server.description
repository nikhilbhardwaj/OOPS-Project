Dynamic host information system - server
	
dhis is a client-server architecture meant to update databases
for systems which are assigned a dynamic ip[v4] address.

by the means of a dhis client a host which is assigned a dynamic
ip address (either from its isp or from dhcp) is able to
communicate with a dhis server in order to advertise its newly
acquired ip address.
