Prolog-inspired python logic programming toolkit
	
pyke introduces a form of logic programming (inspired by prolog) to python by
providing a knowledge-based inference engine (or "expert system").

unlike prolog, pyke integrates with python code allowing one to invoke pyke
from python and intermingle python statements and expressions within your
expert system rules.
