Namespace aware sax-parser utility library (ooo 3.1 branch)
	
libxml is a namespace aware sax-parser utility library. it eases the
pain of implementing non-trivial sax input handlers. the original
code of these classes had been written by peter becker for the
jcommon library.

libxml replaces the jcommon-xml classes, which were not namespace aware.
