Cvs to bazaar importer
	
this is a plugin for bazaar, which converts from cvs to bzr using cvsps as the
program that analyzes the cvs history to extract "patchsets". the main
difference from other tools (such as tailor) is that it converts all
branches, rather than just converting the mainline branch.

one key advantage of using cvsps is that it tries to guess what ancestor
branch an new branch is based from. which allows branches of branches to be
tracked.
