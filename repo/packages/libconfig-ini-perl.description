Perl module for reading and writing .ini files
	
config::ini::reader and config::ini::writer are "yet another config module"
implementing yet another slightly different take on the undeniably easy to
read ".ini" file format. their default behavior is quite similar to that of
config::tiny, on which it is based.

the chief difference is that config::ini is designed to be subclassed to
allow for side-effects and self-reconfiguration to occur during the course of
reading its input.
