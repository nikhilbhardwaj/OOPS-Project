Regular expression development and execution tool
	
redet allows the user to construct regular expressions and test them against
input data by executing any of a variety of search programs, editors,
and programming languages that make use of regular expressions. when a
suitable regular expression has been constructed it may be saved to a file.

redet stands for regular expression development and execution
tool. for each program, a palette showing the available regular expression
syntax is provided. selections from the palette may be copied to the
regular expression window with a mouse click. users may add their own
definitions to the palette via their initialization file.
redet also keeps a list of the regular expressions executed, from which
entries may be copied back into the regular expression under construction.
the history list is saved to a file and restored on startup, so it
persists across sessions.

so long as the underlying program supports unicode, redet allows utf-8
unicode in both test data and regular expressions.
