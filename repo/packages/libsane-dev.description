Api development library for scanners [development files]
	
sane stands for "scanner access now easy" and is an application
programming interface (api) that provides standardized access to any
raster image scanner hardware (flatbed scanner, hand-held scanner,
video- and still-cameras, frame-grabbers, etc.). the sane standard is
free and its discussion and development are open to everybody. the
current source code is written to support several operating systems,
including gnu/linux, os/2, win32 and various unices and is available
under the gnu general public license (commercial applications and
backends are welcome, too, however).

this package contains the files needed to build your applications
using sane.
