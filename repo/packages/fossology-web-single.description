Architecture for analyzing software, web interface  (single machine case)
	
the fossology project is a web based framework that allows you to
upload software to be picked apart and then analyzed by software agents
which produce results that are then browsable via the web interface.
existing agents include license analysis, metadata extraction, and mime
type identification.

this package depends on the packages needed for the web interface and
to make a single machine install properly.
