Gnu dbm database routines (runtime version)
	
gnu dbm ('gdbm') is a library of database functions that use extendible
hashing and works similarly to the standard unix 'dbm' functions.

the basic use of 'gdbm' is to store key/data pairs in a data file, thus
providing a persistent version of the 'dictionary' abstract data type
('hash' to perl programmers).
