Passive asset detection system
	
pads is a signature based detection engine used to passively
detect network assets. it can determine which systems are
alive in the network as well as the services they make use
of. it is designed to complement ids technology by providing
context to ids alerts. unlike other tools, like nmap, it will
not generate any network traffic which makes it useful to
run both on network capture files and promiscuous mode
interfaces.
