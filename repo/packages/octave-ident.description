System identification functions for octave
	
this package provides functions to do additional system
identification control theory under octave, a numerical computation
software. this package allows you to create theta structures from the
iir system ay = bx (mktheta), a more general theta structure for miso
systems (poly2th), simulate the effects of the miso system defined by
a theta (idsim) and plot the results of that simulation (idplot).

this octave add-on package is part of the octave-forge project.
