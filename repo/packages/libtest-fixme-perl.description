Perl module to check code for fixme declarations
	
when coding it is common to come up against problems that need to be
addressed but that are not a big deal at the moment. what generally happens
is that the coder adds comments like:


 # fixme - add checking of user privileges here.


test::fixme allows you to add a test file that ensures that none of these get
forgotten in the module.
