Haskell monadic parser combinator library for ghc; profiling libraries
	
this package provides a library for the haskell programming language,
compiled for profiling.

parsec is designed from scratch as an industrial-strength parser
library.  it is simple, safe, well documented, has extensive libraries
and good error messages, and is also fast.  it is defined
as a monad transformer that can be stacked on arbitrary monads, and
it is also parametric in the input stream type.
