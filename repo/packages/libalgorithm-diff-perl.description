Module to find differences between files
	
algorithm::diff is a perl module that allows users to analyze text based on a
longest common subsequence (lcs) algorithm. it can compare two files and find
the differences between them, which can produce the same information as the
common unix tool 'diff'.

there is an xs-optimized implementation of the core loop, which accelerates
some types of diff output (see libalgorithm-diff-xs-perl).
