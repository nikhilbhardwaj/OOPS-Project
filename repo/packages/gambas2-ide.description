Visual development environment for the gambas programming language
	
gambas is a programming language based on a basic interpreter with
object extensions - like visual basic, though it is not a clone!
it has many components for developing internationalized,
desktop-independent, database- and network-enabled applications.
even games can be developed very quickly using its rad environment.

this package includes the gambas development environment and the
database manager.
