Development files for the djvu image format
	
djvu image format static library and development files.

djvu is a set of compression technologies, a file format, and a
software platform for the delivery over the web of digital documents,
scanned documents, and high resolution images.

djvu documents download and display extremely quickly, and look
exactly the same on all platforms.  djvu can be seen as a superior
alternative to pdf and postscript for digital documents, to tiff (and
pdf) for scanned documents, to jpeg for photographs and pictures, and
to gif for large palettized images.  djvu is the only web format that
is practical for distributing high-resolution scanned documents in
color.
