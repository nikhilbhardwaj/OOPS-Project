Client for spamassassin spam filtering daemon
	
spamc is the client to communicate with spamd, the daemonized form of
spamassassin (see the spamassassin package). it is written in c for
maximum speed and minimum loading overhead.

spamc is quite useful for integrating spamassassin into an mta or
into a .procmailrc file because of its speed.

this package is useless unless you have spamassassin installed,
either on this machine or another local machine (i.e. a mail server).
