Pbuilder running on cowdancer
	
'cowbuilder' command is a wrapper for pbuilder which allows using
pbuilder-like interface over cowdancer environment.

pbuilder is a tool for building and testing debian package inside a clean
chroot, and cowbuilder allows chroot to be recreated using
hard-linked copies with copy-on-write, which makes creation and
destruction of chroots fast.
