Module to search for files based on rules
	
file::find::rule is a perl module which essentially provides an easy-to-use
interface to the popular module, file::find. it provides a way to build rules
that specify desired file and directory names using a text-globbing syntax
(provided by text::glob). this makes it useful for simple tasks, like finding
all ".pm" files in a given directory.
