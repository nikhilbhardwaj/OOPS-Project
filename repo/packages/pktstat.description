Top-like utility for network connections usage
	
pktstat displays a real-time list of active connections seen on a
network interface, and how much bandwidth is being used by what.

it partially decodes http and ftp protocols to show what filename is
being transferred, as well as x11 application names. entries hang
around on the screen for a few seconds so you can see what just
happened.

it also accepts bpf expressions.
