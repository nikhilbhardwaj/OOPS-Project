Input system for japanese - development files
	
canna provides a unified user interface for japanese input. it is based
on a client-server model and supports automatic kana-to-kanji conversion.

it supports multiple clients (including kinput2 and canuum), and allows
them all to work in the same way, sharing customization files,
romaji-to-kana conversion rules and conversion dictionaries.

this package provides the headers and static libraries needed to develop
software based on canna.
