Program for speech analysis and synthesis
	
according to its authors, praat is "doing phonetics by computer".  through
its graphical interface, several speech analysis functionalities are
available: spectrograms, cochleograms, and pitch and formant
extraction.  articulatory synthesis, as well as synthesis from pitch,
formant, and intensity are also available.  other features are
segmentation, labelling using the phonetic alphabet, and computation of
statistics.  praat is configurable and extensible through its own scripting
language and has provisions for communicating with other programs.
