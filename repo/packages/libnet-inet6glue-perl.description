Glue module to make perl modules ipv6 ready
	
net::inet6glue is a collection of modules to make common modules ipv6 ready
by hotpatching them.

unfortunatly the current state of ipv6 support in perl is that no ipv6
support is in the core and that a lot of important modules (like net::ftp,
net::smtp, lwp,...) do not support ipv6 even if the modules for ipv6 sockets
socket6, io::socket::inet6 are available.
