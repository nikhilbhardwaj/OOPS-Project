Binary i/o stream class library
	
the binary i/o stream class library presents a platform-independent way to
access binary data streams in c++. the library is hardware independent in
the form that it transparently converts between the different forms of
machine-internal binary data representation. it further employs no special
i/o protocol and can be used on arbitrary binary data sources.
