Qt-based library that maps json data to qvariant objects - development files
	
json (javascript object notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format.
it can represents integer, real number, string, an ordered sequence of value,
and a collection of name/value pairs.

qjson is a qt-based library that maps json data to qvariant objects: json
arrays will be mapped to qvariantlist instances, while json objects will be
mapped to qvariantmap.

these are the development files.
