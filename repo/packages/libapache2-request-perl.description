Generic apache request library - perl modules
	
the generic apache request library (apr) contains modules for manipulating
client request data with the apache api from perl and c. functionality
includes:


 - parsing of application/x-www-form-urlencoded data
 - parsing of multipart/form-data
 - parsing of http cookies


this package contains the perl bindings, which are simply a thin xs layer on
top of libapreq, making them a lighter and faster alternative to cgi.pm and
cgi::cookie.
