Freetype-based font drawing library for x
	
xft provides a client-side font api for x applications, making the freetype
font rasterizer available to x clients.  fontconfig is used for font
specification resolution.  where available, the render extension handles
glyph drawing; otherwise, the core x protocol is used.
