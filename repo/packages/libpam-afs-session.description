Pam module to set up a pag and obtain afs tokens
	
afs is a distributed network file system.  it uses in-kernel credentials
(afs tokens) obtained from kerberos tickets for authentication and access
control, and controls access to those credentials via pags (process
authentication groups).  this module provides a pam session
implementation that puts new logins in separate pags and optionally runs
an external program (usually aklog) to obtain tokens from kerberos
tickets.  it is designed to work with a kerberos pam module that obtains
the initial kerberos tickets.
