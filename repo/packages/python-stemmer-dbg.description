Python bindings for libstemmer - snowball stemming algorithms (debug extension)
	
pystemmer provides access to efficient algorithms for calculating a "stemmed"
form of a word.  this is a form with most of the common morphological endings
removed; hopefully representing a common linguistic base form.

pystemmer provides algorithms for several (mainly european) languages, by
wrapping the libstemmer library from the snowball project in a python module.

this package contains the extensions built for the python debug interpreter.
