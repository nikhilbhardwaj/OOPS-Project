The lv2 audio plugin specification
	
this package contains the 'core' lv2 audio plugin specification,
including data required by hosts to make effective use of lv2 plugins.
lv2 is a simple but extensible successor of ladspa plugins,
intended to address the limitations of ladspa
which many applications have outgrown.
