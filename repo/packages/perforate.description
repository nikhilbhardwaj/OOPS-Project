Utilities to save disk space
	
gnu cp used to detect files that contain 0-filled holes and save disk space
by skipping them with lseek when writing a file and thus not allocating
disk blocks. unfortunately it does no longer. so here is program to make
holes in existing files.

also there are some scripts that help cleaning up the hard disk
(finding duplicated and/or unstripped files).
