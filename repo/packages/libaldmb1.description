Dynamic universal music bibliotheque, allegro version
	
dumb is a tracker library with support for it, xm, s3m and mod files. it
targets maximum accuracy to the original formats, with low-pass resonant
filters for the it files, accurate timing and pitching, and three resampling
quality settings (aliasing, linear interpolation and cubic interpolation).

this package contains the libaldmb1 runtime library, a library for module
playback that uses the allegro library. if you do not plan to use allegro
with your project, please consider the libdumb1 library.
