Library for full-featured text search engine (development)
	
clucene is a c++ port of the popular apache lucene search engine
(http://lucene.apache.org/java). it is released under lgpl or the apache
license.

clucene aims to be a high-speed alternative to java lucene, its api is very
similar to that of the java version. clucene has recently been brought up to
date with lucene 1.4.3. it contains most of the same functionality as the
java version, except for socket, threading and the special caching
modifications.

this package contains the static libraries and headers for developing
applications that use the clucene search api.
