Keep your handy modules organized
	
the toolkit module provides a standard location to store modules that you use
all the time, and then loads them for you automatically. for example, instead
of always writing:


 use strict;
 use warnings;
 use carp;
 use smart::comments;


in every program/module, you can just write:


 use toolkit;


and put all your favorite modules in a file.
