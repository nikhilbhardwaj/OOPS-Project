Shared files for the mutter window manager
	
mutter is a small window manager, using gtk+ and clutter to do
everything.

mutter is the clutter-based evolution of metacity, which, as the
author says, is a "boring window manager for the adult in you. many
window managers are like marshmallow froot loops; metacity is like
cheerios."

this package contains the shared files.
