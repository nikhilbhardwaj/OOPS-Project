Draws mandelbrot and julia fractals
	
fraqtive is a program for drawing mandelbrot and julia fractals.
it uses a very fast algorithm and generates high quality, smooth
images. it is fully interactive, allowing for real-time mouse
navigation and dynamic generation of the julia fractal preview.
opengl-rendered 3d view of the fractals is also supported.
