Symmetrical eigenvalue routines for numpy
	
a python wrapper for the lapack functions to solve the standard and
generalized eigenvalue problems for symmetric (hermitian) positive definite
matrices. those specialized algorithms give an important speed-up with respect
to the generic lapack eigenvalue problem solver used by numpy (linalg.eig and
linalg.eigh).

this is dummy transitional package -- please use scipy's scipy.linalg.eigh
for symeig functionality.
