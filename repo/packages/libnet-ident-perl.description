Perl module to lookup the username on the remote end of a tcp/ip connection
	
net::ident is a perl module implementing the rfc1413 identification protocol,
also known as "ident".

it provides both a simple interface for doing one ident lookup at a time, and
an asynchronous interface to perform (possibly) many simultaneous lookups, or
simply continue serving other things while the lookup is proceeding.
