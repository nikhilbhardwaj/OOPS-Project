Perl module to extract which modules some code uses
	
module::extract::use extracts the names of the modules used in a file using a
static analysis. it uses ppi (perl parsing interface) to tokenize and extract
the file data.

since this module does not run code, it cannot find dynamic uses of modules,
such as eval "require $class".
