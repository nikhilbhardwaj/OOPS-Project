Library to tune and command digital video broadcasting cards
	
the dvb standard (digital video broadcasting) is an integrated package of
standards for the distribution of terrestrial (dvb-t), satellite (dvb-s)
and cable (dvb-c) digital television.

this library offers an abstraction layer over the linux dvb kernel drivers
to tune and command dvb cards that are connected to the system. common uses
include scanning transponders, selecting channels and retrieving raw mpeg-2
transport streams (ts).

this package contains the header files and static libraries needed to
compile applications or shared objects that use libdvb.
