Converts between different systems of units
	
gnu 'units' program converts quantities expressed in various scales
to their equivalents in other scales.  the 'units' program can only
handle multiplicative scale changes directly.  it uses a functional
notation for "nonlinear" conversions such a fahrenheit temperature
to celsius temperature.
