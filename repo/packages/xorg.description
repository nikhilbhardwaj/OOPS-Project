X.org x window system
	
this metapackage provides the components for a standalone
workstation running the x window system.  it provides the x libraries, an x
server, a set of fonts, and a group of basic x clients and utilities.

higher level metapackages, such as those for desktop environments, can
depend on this package and simplify their dependencies.

it should be noted that a package providing x-window-manager should also
be installed to ensure a comfortable x experience.
