Scofield reference notes, 1917 edition for sword
	
scofield reference notes, 1917 edition based on the version at
http://bible.crosswalk.com/ with formatting changes and corrections.

this package requires a libsword version of at least 1.5.1a to access
through a sword front end.  however, this is not declared as a dependency
because you may have occasion to install just the text without any sort
of front end or other interface.
