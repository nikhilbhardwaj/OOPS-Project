Poe component that manages and keeps alive client connections
	
poe::component::client::keepalive creates and manages connections for other
components. it maintains a cache of kept-alive connections for quick reuse.
it is written specifically for clients that can benefit from kept-alive
connections, such as http clients. using it for one-shot connections would
probably be silly.
