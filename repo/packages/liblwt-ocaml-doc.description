Cooperative light-weight thread library (documentation)
	
lwt is a library of cooperative threads implemented in monadic style.
with respect to preemptive threads, cooperative threads are not using
a scheduler to distribute processor time between threads. instead of
this, each thread must tell the others that he wants to let them
work.

this package contains the complete api reference for lwt, including
openssl, glib bindings and examples.
