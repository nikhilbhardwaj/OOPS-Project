Handoff library for gpe calendar
	
libhandoff is used in the gpe palmtop environment to
cause another program instance to come to the
foreground. this is used when alarm triggers (like atd)
wake the device and then need to load another program to
show the reason for the device waking up. when
gpe-calendar starts it looks at a well known location to
find another instance of itself. if it does, it tells
that instance to grab the focus.
