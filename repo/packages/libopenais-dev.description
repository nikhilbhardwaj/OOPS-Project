Standards-based cluster framework (developer files)
	
the openais project is a project to implement a production quality
"revised bsd" licensed implementation of the sa forum's application
interface specification. the project implements cutting edge research
on virtual synchrony to provide 100% correct operation in the face of
failures or partitionable networks with excellent performance
characteristics.

the application interface specification is a software api and policies
which are used to develop applications that maintain service during
faults.
the api consists of availability management framework (amf) which
provides application failover, cluster membership (clm),
checkpointing (ckpt), event (evt), messaging (msg), and
distributed locks (dlock).

this package contains header files required to build clients for the
openais infrastructure.
