The qt3 configuration application
	
the qt configuration program allows endusers to configure the look
and behavior of any qt3 application. it is mostly only necessary
on systems which don't run kde because the kde control center already
covers this configuration automatically for the users qt3 applications
according to his desktop settings in kde. however, if you need to run
cjk-fonts or other non-latin scripts, you will most likely want to
install this package.
