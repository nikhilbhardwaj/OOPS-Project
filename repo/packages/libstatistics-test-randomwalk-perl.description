Perl module to perform a random walk statistical test
	
statistics::test::randomwalk implements a random walk test of a random number
generator as outlined in blobel et al. basically, it tests that the numbers
(in the interval between 0 and 1) generated by a random number generator are
distributed evenly. it divides [0,1] into n evenly sized bins and calculates
the number of expected and actual random numbers in the bin. (in fact, this
counts the cumulated numbers, but that works the same.)
