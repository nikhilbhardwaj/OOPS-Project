Suit of nonlinear and differential/algebraic equation solvers
	
the family of solvers referred to as sundials consists of solvers cvode
(for ode systems), cvodes (ode with sensitivity analysis capabilities),
ida (for differential-algebraic systems), and kinsol (for nonlinear
algebraic systems).

this package depends on all other packages containing the shared
libraries for the subcomponents of sundials: cvode, cvodes, ida,
kinsol, and nvector_serial.
