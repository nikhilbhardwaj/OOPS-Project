this package allows you to manage previously defined html templates
in an object-oriented fashion. a template consists of text and special
labeled blocks and placeholders. the content of blocks can be re-used
and parsed multiple times with different placeholder values, filled
from php code with content.

the isotemplate api gives you a maximum of flexibility, allowing any
level of block nesting.
