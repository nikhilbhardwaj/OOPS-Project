Perl module to detect memory cycles in perl objects
	
devel::cycle is a developer's tool for finding memory cycles in perl objects.
since perl provides its automatic memory management using reference counting,
cyclical/circular references will result in memory that will never be freed.
optionally, padwalker (libpadwalker-perl) module enables reporting of cycles
in code closures as well.
