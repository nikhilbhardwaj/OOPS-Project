Pyorbit: development files
	
it aims to take advantage of new features found in orbit2 to make
language bindings more efficient.  this includes:

  - use of orbit2 type libraries to generate stubs
  - use of the orbit_small_invoke_stub() call for operation
    invocation, which allows for short circuited invocation on local
    objects.


where it makes sense, this binding tries to stay compatible with the
python language mapping, which can be found on the omg web site:

this package contains development files necessary to develop extensions
for the module using the c language.
