An implementation of the at&t plan 9 shell
	
rc is a command interpreter and programming language
similar to sh(1). it is based on the at&t plan 9 shell of the
same name. the shell offers a c-like syntax (much more so
than the c shell), and a powerful mechanism for manipulating
variables. it is reasonably small and reasonably fast,
especially when compared to contemporary shells. its use is
intended to be interactive, but the language lends itself well
to scripts.
