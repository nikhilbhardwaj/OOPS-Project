Let a remote site change their newsgroups subscription
	
gup, the group update program is a unix mail-server that lets a remote
site change their newsgroups subscription without requiring the
intervention of the news administrator at the feed site.

gup is suited to news administrators that find they are spending an
inordinate amount of time editing the inn newsfeeds file on behalf of
the remote sites.
