The gpl ghostscript postscript/pdf interpreter
	
ghostscript is used for postscript/pdf preview and printing.  usually as
a back-end to a program such as ghostview, it can display postscript and pdf
documents in an x11 environment.

furthermore, it can render postscript and pdf files as graphics to be printed
on non-postscript printers. supported printers include common
dot-matrix, inkjet and laser models.

package gsfonts contains a set of standard fonts for ghostscript.
