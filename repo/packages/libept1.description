High-level library for managing debian package information
	
the library defines a very minimal framework in which many sources of data
about debian packages can be implemented and queried together.

the library includes four data sources:


 * apt: access the apt database
 * debtags: access the debtags tag information
 * popcon: access popcon package scores
 * the xapian index built by apt-xapian-index


this is the shared library.
