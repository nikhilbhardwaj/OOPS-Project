Equinox osgi framework
	
the eclipse platform is an open and extensible platform for anything and yet
nothing in particular. it provides a foundation for constructing and running
integrated software-development tools. the eclipse platform allows tool
builders to independently develop tools that integrate with other people's
tools so seamlessly you can't tell where one tool ends and another starts.

this package includes only the eclipse equinox osgi framework, which can
be used outside eclipse.
