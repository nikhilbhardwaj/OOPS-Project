Qt 4 opengl module
	
qt is a cross-platform c++ application framework. qt's primary feature
is its rich set of widgets that provide standard gui functionality.

the qtopengl module offers classes that make it easy to use opengl in qt
applications.

opengl is a standard api for rendering 3d graphics. opengl only deals with 3d
rendering and provides little or no support for gui programming issues.
