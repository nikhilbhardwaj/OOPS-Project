Mjpeg video plugin for libavifile
	
this package provides a plugin for the avifile library to de/encode
mjpeg video streams -  this implementation is rather slower and
serves just as a sample plugin implementation. usage of ffmpeg or
win32 codecs is a better choice.

in general you do not need this plugin.
