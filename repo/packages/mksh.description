Mirbsd korn shell
	
mksh is the mirbsd enhanced version of the public domain korn
shell (pdksh), a bourne-compatible shell which is largely similar
to the original at&t korn shell; mksh is the only pdksh derivate
currently being actively developed.
it includes bug fixes and feature improvements, in order to produce a
modern, robust shell good for interactive and especially script use.
mksh has utf-8 support (in substring operations and the emacs editing
mode) and, while r39c corresponds to openbsd 4.6-current ksh (without
gnu bash-like ps1 and fancy character classes), adheres to susv4 and
is much more robust.
the code has been cleaned up and simplified, bugs fixed, standards
compliance added, and several enhancements (for extended
compatibility to other modern shells â€“ as well as a couple of its
own) are available.
this shell is debian policy 10.4 compliant and may be used as /bin/sh
on debian systems.

the mksh-static binary is a version of mksh, linked against dietlibc
(if dietlibc exists for that debian architecture), and optimised for
small code size, for example for use on initrd or initramfs images,
installation or rescue systems.

a sample ~/.mkshrc is included in /usr/share/doc/mksh/examples and
provided as /etc/mkshrc conffile, which is sourced by another file
/etc/skel/.mkshrc users are recommended to copy into their home.
