Unified language for form-compilers
	
ufl (unified form language) is a unified language for definition of
variational forms intended for finite element discretization. more precisely,
it defines a fixed interface for choosing finite element spaces and defining
expressions for weak forms in a notation close to mathematical notation.
the form compilers ffc and syfi use ufl as their end-user interface,
producing ufc implementations as their output.
