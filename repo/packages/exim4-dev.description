Header files for the exim mta (v4) packages
	
exim (v4) is a mail transport agent. this package contains header
files that can be used to compile code that is then dynamically linked
to exim's local_scan interface.

the debian exim4 packages have their own web page,
http://pkg-exim4.alioth.debian.org/. there is also a debian-specific
faq list. information about the way the debian packages are
configured can be found in
/usr/share/doc/exim4-base/readme.debian.gz, which additionally contains
information about the way the debian binary packages are built. the
very extensive upstream documentation is shipped in
/usr/share/doc/exim4-base/spec.txt.gz. to repeat the debconf-driven
configuration process in a standard setup, invoke dpkg-reconfigure
exim4-config. there is a debian-centered mailing list,
pkg-exim4-users@lists.alioth.debian.org. please ask debian-specific
questions there, and only write to the upstream exim-users mailing
list if you are sure that your question is not debian-specific. you
can find the subscription web page on
http://lists.alioth.debian.org/mailman/listinfo/pkg-exim4-users
