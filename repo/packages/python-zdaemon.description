Daemon process control library and tools for unix-based systems
	
`zdaemon` is a python package which provides apis for managing applications
run as daemons. its principal use to date has been to manage the application
server and storage server daemons for zope / zeo, although it is not limited
to running python-based applications (for instance, it has been used to manage
the 'spread' daemon).
