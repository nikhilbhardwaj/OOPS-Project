Terminal multiplexor with vt100/ansi terminal emulation
	
screen is a terminal multiplexor that runs several separate "screens" on a
single physical character-based terminal.  each virtual terminal emulates a
dec vt100 plus several ansi x3.64 and iso 2022 functions.  screen sessions
can be detached and resumed later on a different terminal.

screen also supports a whole slew of other features.  some of these are:
configurable input and output translation, serial port support, configurable
logging, multi-user support, and utf8 charset support.
