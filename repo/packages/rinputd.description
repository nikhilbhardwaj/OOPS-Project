Server daemon for receiving user input events
	
this package provides a remote input server daemon which listens for
connections from rinput clients (such as mobile phone applications). these
authenticate via a secure ssl socket through the cyrus sasl password
database, /etc/sasldb2. the uinput user input event interface can
then create virtual devices such as a keyboard and mouse under the
remote control of the client.
