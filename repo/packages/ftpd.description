File transfer protocol (ftp) server
	
this is the netkit ftp server. you are recommended to use one of its
alternatives, such as vsftpd, proftpd, or pure-ftpd.

this server supports ipv6, and can be used in standalone mode as well
as in inetd-slave mode, but other servers have better long-term
security screening.

the server can be used with gnu/linux and with gnu/kfreebsd.
