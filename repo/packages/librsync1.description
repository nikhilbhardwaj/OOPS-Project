Rsync remote-delta algorithm library
	
librsync implements the rsync remote-delta algorithm, which allows for
efficient remote updates of a file, without requiring the old and new versions
to both be present at the transmitter. the library uses a stream-based designed
so that it can be easily embedded into network applications.

the main application at the moment is rproxy, but the library should eventually
be generally useful.
