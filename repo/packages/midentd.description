An ident replacement with masquerading support.
	
with your average identd on a masquerading firewall, if an ident
request comes in for a masqueraded connection, it will return
'error : no-user' or something along those lines. this may be
quite irritating at times, with, for example, irc servers that
won't let you in if they don't get a valid ident reply.
