Multiple-personality middleware for ada (servers)
	
polyorb provides a uniform solution to build distributed applications; relying
either on industrial-strength middleware standards such as corba, the
distributed system annex of ada 95, distribution programming paradigms such as
web services, message oriented middleware (mom), or to implement
application-specific middleware.

this package provides various middleware servers needed to run a distributed
application and tools to interact with these servers.
