Transformers for reader and state monoids; documentation
	
this package provides the documentation for a library for the haskell
programming language.
see http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on haskell.

this library provides monoid transformers for the reader monoid and
the state monoid. there's no monoid transformer for the writer monoid
since the writer monad transforms a monoid into a monad.
