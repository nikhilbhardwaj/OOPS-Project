Updates .xvpics thumbnails from the command line
	
this package includes a shell script and a c helper program to update
xv/zgv/xzgv thumbnails from the command line.

note that the thumbnails used by gnome and kde are in a different,
incompatible format; you will need to use a tool designed for those
desktops to create thumbnails for nautilus or konqueror.
