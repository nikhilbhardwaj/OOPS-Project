Rename attachments on the fly
	
renattach is a small, efficient and surprisingly effective filter
designed primarily to offer an additional level of safety to windows
users whose e-mails pass through a unix-like mail server. many modern
viruses are spread through e-mail, and renattach combats such viruses by
filtering e-mail attachments based on file extension. the idea is to
rename potentially dangerous attachments (executable ones) so that
the user, or the user's poorly written e-mail software, does not
accidentally execute the attachment.
