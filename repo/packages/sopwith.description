Port of the 1980's side-scrolling wwi dogfighting game
	
this is an updated version of the 1980's game developed by david l. clark of
bmb compuscience canada - it has been adapted to run under *nix using the sdl
toolkit. poor graphics, stupid ai, and horrible sound await you. the gameplay
is simple, addictive, and fun. a `side-scroller', you pilot your biplane
across a static field, destorying enemy encampments and planes.
