Data files for pingus, a free lemmings(tm) clone
	
pingus is a free clone of the popular lemmings game.

your goal is to guide a horde of penguins through a world full of obstacles
and penguin traps to safety. although penguins (unlike lemmings) are rather
smart, they sometimes lack the necessary overview and now rely on you to
save them.

this package contains the data files.
