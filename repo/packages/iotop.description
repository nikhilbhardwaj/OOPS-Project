Simple top-like i/o monitor
	
iotop does for i/o usage what top(1) does for cpu usage. it watches i/o
usage information output by the linux kernel and displays a table of
current i/o usage by processes on the system. it is handy for answering
the question "why is the disk churning so much?".

iotop can only run under a linux 2.6.20 or later kernel built with the
config_taskstats, config_task_delay_acct, config_task_io_accounting and
config_vm_event_counters build config options on.
