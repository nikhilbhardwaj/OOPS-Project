Lists available package versions with distribution
	
apt-show-versions parses the dpkg status file and the apt lists for
the installed and available package versions and distribution and
shows upgrade options within the specific distribution of the selected
package.

this is really useful if you have a mixed stable/testing environment
and want to list all packages which are from testing and can be
upgraded in testing.
