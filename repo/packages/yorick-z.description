Zlib, jpeg and png support for the yorick language
	
this is a compiled add-on for yorick (an interpreted computer language
specialized for numerical and scientific problems).  yorick-z adds
support for zlib (the data compression system used by gzip), png (a
lossless image compression format), and jpeg (a lossy image compression
format).
