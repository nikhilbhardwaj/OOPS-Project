Anti-virus utility for unix - test files
	
clam antivirus is an anti-virus toolkit for unix. the main purpose of
this software is the integration with mail servers (attachment
scanning). the package provides a flexible and scalable
multi-threaded daemon in the clamav-daemon package, a command-line
scanner in the clamav package, and a tool for automatic updating via
the internet in the clamav-freshclam package. the programs are based
on libclamav6, which can be used by other software.

this package contains files 'infected' with a test signature. the test
signature (clamav-test-signature) should be detectable by all
anti-virus programs.
