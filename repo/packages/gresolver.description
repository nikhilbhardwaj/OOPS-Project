gresolver is a graphical tool for dns queries. it allows system administrators
to quickly and easily make the most common dns queries without constructing
lengthy dig commands.

gresolver supports all the main resource record types, including aaaa, axfr,

dotted-quad ip addresses when doing ptr queries. there are checkboxes for
controlling the most commonly-used options.
