Perl module to check that file names in a distribution are portable
	
test::portability::files is used to check the portability across operating
systems of the names of the files present in the distribution of a module.
the tests use the advices given in perlport/"files and filesystems". the
author of a distribution can select which tests to execute.

to use this module, simply copy the code from the synopsis in a test file
named t/portfs.t for example, and add it to your manifest. you can delete the
call to options() to enable only most common tests.
