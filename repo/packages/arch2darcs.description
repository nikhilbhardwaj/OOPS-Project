Convert arch/tla repositories to darcs
	
arch2darcs is used to convert an arch repository to darcs,
automatically preserving:


 - all original logs,
 - modification dates,
 - all adds, deletes, and renames that were versioned with tla,
 - files in arch.


arch2darcs can process entire arch/tla branches at once.
