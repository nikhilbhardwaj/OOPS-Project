Manage debian source packages
	
apt-src is a command line interface for downloading, installing, upgrading,
and tracking debian source packages. it makes source package management
feel a lot like using apt to manage binary packages, and is being used as
a testbed to work on adding source dependencies to debian.

it can be run as a normal user, or as root. if you want a convenient way to
track updates to packages while preserving your local modifications, this is
a way to do that.
