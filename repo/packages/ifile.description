A text/e-mail/spam filter capable of learning
	
a text filter that uses machine learning to classify texts into
groups. ifile works great as a spam filter. the text is classified by
a simple statistical method called naive bayes, which basically
considers each text an unordered collection of words and classifies
by matching the distribution with the most closely matching group
distribution. alternatives to ifile are annoyance-filter, bogofilter,
spamoracle, and spamprobe.
