Module providing asynchronous filehandle i/o
	
io::async is a collection of perl modules that allow programs to perform
various operations on filehandles asynchronously.

typically, a program would use a main io::async::loop which would contain the
other objects that perform the actual i/o work required by the program. this
versatile loop supports features like timers and signal handlers through its
various included subclasses.
