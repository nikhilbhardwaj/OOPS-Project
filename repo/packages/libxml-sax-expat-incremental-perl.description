Xml::sax::expat subclass for non-blocking (incremental) parsing
	
most xml parsers give a callback interface within an encapsulated loop and
eventually, when the xml source is depleted by the parser, the parse function
will return.

sometimes you don't want the parser to control the loop for you. for example,
if you need to retrieve your xml in chunks in a funny way, you might need to
use a kind of iterator to get your xml data.

this module provides this possibility.
