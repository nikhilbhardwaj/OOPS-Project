Command-line spf query tool
	
the spfqtool can be used to test spf ("sender policy framework") policies. it
takes a sender and a recipient email, a source ip address and an smtp helo
name. using the spf policy announced by the sender's email address domain,
the tool shows whether an email with the two correspondents would be allowed
to originate from the given ip address.
