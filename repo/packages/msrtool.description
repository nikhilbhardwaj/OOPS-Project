Dump chipset-specific msr contents
	
the msrtool utility can dump msr (model-specific register) contents,
which is useful for debugging and development.

the tool currently supports the following chipsets:

 - amd geode lx
 - amd geode cs5536
 - amd k8


it has been developed for the coreboot project (see http://coreboot.org for
details on coreboot), but may also be useful for other purposes.
