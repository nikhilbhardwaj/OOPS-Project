Automated rebuilding support for python modules
	
this package contains the 'update-python-modules' script, which takes
care of byte-compilation of python-only modules.

private modules are automatically rebuilt upon major python upgrades,
avoiding the need for strong dependencies.

public modules are automatically made available for all installed
python versions.
