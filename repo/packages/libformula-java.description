Excel(tm) style formula expressions library
	
libformula provides excel-style-expressions. the implementation provided
here is very generic and can be used in any application that needs to
compute formulas.

the syntax is based on the openformula-specifications, but with carefully
pruning away all the spreadsheet specific parts (like references to
cell-ranges).
