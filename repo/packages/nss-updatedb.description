Cache name service directories in db format
	
this package contains a script, nss_updatedb, which can be
used to maintain local caches of user and group directories.
these can then be used by the db name service switch module
(libnss-db) to provide name service when the system is offline.

these tools are designed to work with libpam-ldap and libnss-ldap.
