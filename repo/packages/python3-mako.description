Fast and lightweight templating for the python 3 platform
	
mako is a template library written in python. it provides a familiar, non-xml
syntax which compiles into python modules for maximum performance. mako's
syntax and api borrows from the best ideas of many others, including django
templates, cheetah, myghty, and genshi. conceptually, mako is an embedded
python (i.e. python server page) language, which refines the familiar ideas of
componentized layout and inheritance to produce one of the most
straightforward and flexible models available, while also maintaining close
ties to python calling and scoping semantics.
