Robust, reliable performance measurement and analysis
	
this package provides a library for the haskell programming language.
see http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on haskell.

this library provides a powerful but simple way to measure the performance of
haskell code.  it provides both a framework for executing and analysing
benchmarks and a set of driver functions that makes it easy to build and run
benchmarks, and to analyse their results.

the fastest way to get started is to read the documentation and examples in
the criterion.main module.
