Core perl modules
	
architecture independent perl modules.  these modules are part of perl and
required if the `perl' package is installed.

note that this package only exists to save archive space and should be
considered an internal implementation detail of the `perl' package.
other packages should not depend on `perl-modules' directly, they
should use `perl' (which depends on `perl-modules') instead.
