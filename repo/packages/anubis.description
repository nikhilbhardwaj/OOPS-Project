An smtp message submission daemon
	
gnu anubis is an intermediate layer between a mail user agent (mua) and a mail
transport agent (mta), receiving  messages from the mua, applying to them
a set of predefined changes and finally inserting modified messages into an mta
routing network. the set of changes applied to a message is configurable on
a system-wide and per-user basis. the built-in configuration language used for
defining sets of changes allows for considerable flexibility and is easily
extensible.
