A command line ocr
	
gocr is a multi-platform ocr (optical character recognition) program.

it can read pnm, pbm, pgm, ppm, some pcx and tga image files.

currently the program should be able to handle well scans that have their text
in one column and do not have tables. font sizes of 20 to 60
pixels are supported.

if you want to write your own ocr, libgocr is provided in a separate
package. documentation and graphical wrapper are provided in separated
packages, too.
