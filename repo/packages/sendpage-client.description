Client to send alpha-numeric text pages via snpp
	
to send alphanumeric pages to a pager, if an email gateway is unavailable
or undesirable, software is needed to control a modem which will dial a
paging central, and deliver the pages using an ascii delivery system known
as tap. sendpage implements all aspects of this type of software,
including an snpp client, an snpp server, a queuing engine, a modem
control engine, a tap communication system, and an email notification system.

this package provides the sendpage snpp client.
