An nntp protocol implementation with client and server
	
twisted news provides a very basic nntp server, as well as an nntp
client protocol implementation. two messages storage systems are
supported: the db-api 2.0 backend stores and indexes messages in any
compatible sql database; the twisted dirdbm backend uses serialized
python objects stored directly on the filesystem for message
storage. twisted news also has very rudamentary support for moderated
groups.
