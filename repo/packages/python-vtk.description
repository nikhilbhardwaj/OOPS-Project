Python bindings for vtk
	
the visualization toolkit (vtk) is an object oriented, high level
library that allows one to easily write c++ programs, tcl, python and
java scripts that do 3d visualization.

this provides the shared libraries that enable one to use vtk from python
scripts.  you will need python and vtk installed to use this. some useful
information may be available in /usr/share/doc/python-vtk/.
