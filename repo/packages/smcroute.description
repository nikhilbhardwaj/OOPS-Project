Static multicast router daemon
	
smcroute is a command line tool to manipulate the multicast routes of the
linux kernel. it can be used as an alternative to dynamic multicast routers
like pimd or xorp in situations where static multicast routes should be
maintained and/or no proper igmp signaling exists.
