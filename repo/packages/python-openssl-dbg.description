Python wrapper around the openssl library (debug extension)
	
high-level wrapper around a subset of the openssl library, includes


  * ssl.connection objects, wrapping the methods of python's portable
    sockets
  * callbacks written in python
  * extensive error-handling mechanism, mirroring openssl's error
    codes


a lot of the object methods do nothing more than calling a
corresponding function in the openssl library.

this package contains the debug extension for python-openssl.
