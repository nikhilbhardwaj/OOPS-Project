Realtime computer music and graphics system
	
pure data (also known as pd) is a real-time graphical programming environment
for audio and graphics processing. pd's audio functions are built-in;
graphical computations require separate packages such as gem (graphics
environment for multimedia) or pd-pdp (pd packet).
