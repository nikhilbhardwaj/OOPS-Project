Perl audio file abstraction library
	
audio::file abstracts a single audio file, independent of its format.
using this module you can access a files meta-info like title, album,
etc. as well as the files audio-properties like its length and bitrate.

currently only the formats flac, ogg vorbis and mp3 are supported, but
support for other formats may be easily added.
