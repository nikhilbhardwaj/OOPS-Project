Smtp defence software against spam
	
sauce (software against unsolicited commercial email) sits between
the internet and your existing mail transfer agent (e.g. exim).  it
does a number of checks on incoming mail, including being able to
blacklist senders and their sites automatically when they mail
special `spam bait' addresses.

this is a beta version and is best used by mail experts only.
