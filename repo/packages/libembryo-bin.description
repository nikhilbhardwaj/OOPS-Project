Small compiler creating embryo bytecode
	
embryo is primarily a shared library that gives you an api to load
and control interpreted programs compiled into an abstract machine
bytecode that it understands.  this abstract (or virtual) machine is
similar to a real machine with a cpu, but it is emulated in
software

this package contains the embryo compiler: embryo_cc.
