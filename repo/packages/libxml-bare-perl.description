Perl module to parse xml into a perl hash
	
xml::bare provides a simple api to read and write xml files, it also provides
a function to validate the xml schema. the parser itself is a simple state
engine that is less than 500 lines of c.

in comparison to other available perl xml parsers that create trees, xml::bare
is extremely fast; benchmarking shows that it can even be one or two orders of
magnitude faster than similar modules.
