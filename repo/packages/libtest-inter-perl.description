Framework for more readable interactive test scripts
	
test::inter is another framework for writing test scripts. it is loosely
inspired by test::more, and has most of it's functionality, but it is
not a drop-in replacement.

this framework offers the ability to write the tests in a more readable
format, and you can access specific tests in a reasonably interactive fashion.
