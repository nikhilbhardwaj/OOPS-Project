Virtual web logfile rotater/parser
	
vlogger is a little piece of code borned to handle dealing with large
amounts of virtualhost logs.  it's bad news that apache can't do this
on its own.  vlogger takes piped input from apache, splits it off to
separate files based on the first field.  it uses a file handle cache
so it can't run out of file descriptors.  it will also start a new
logfile every night at midnight, and maintain a symlink to the most
recent file.  for security, it can drop privileges and do a chroot to
the logs directory.
