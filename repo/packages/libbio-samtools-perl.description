Read sam/bam nucleotide sequence aligment database files
	
bio::samtools provides a perl interface to the libbam library for indexed and
unindexed sam/bam sequence alignment databases. it provides support for
retrieving information on individual alignments, read pairs, and alignment
coverage information across large regions. it also provides callback
functionality for calling snps and performing other base-by-base functions.
most operations are compatible with the bioperl bio::seqfeaturei interface,
allowing bam files to be used as a backend to the gbrowse genome browser
application.
