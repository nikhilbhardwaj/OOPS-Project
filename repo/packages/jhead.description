Manipulate the non-image part of exif compliant jpeg files
	
jhead is a command line driven utility for extracting digital camera settings
from the exif format files used by many digital cameras. it handles the
various confusing ways these can be expressed, and displays them as f-stop,
shutter speed, etc. it is also able to reduce the size of digital camera jpegs
without loss of information, by deleting integral thumbnails that digital
cameras put into the exif header.
