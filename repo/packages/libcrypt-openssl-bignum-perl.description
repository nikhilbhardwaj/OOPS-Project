Access openssl multiprecision integer arithmetic libraries
	
presently, many though not all of the arithmetic operations that openssl
provides are exposed to perl cia crypt::openssl::bugnum.  in addition, this
module can be used to provide access to bignum values produced by other
openssl modules, such as key parameters from crypt::openssl::rsa.
