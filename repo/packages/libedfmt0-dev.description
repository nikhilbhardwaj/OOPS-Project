The eresi debug format library
	
libedfmt is the component dedicated for debug formats parsing. this
library simplifies the handling of debug formats that has a different
organization, requires a different parser, and even contain different
information, and provides a uniform representation which contains common
and important information. this library opens the door to automatic debug
format reconstruction in a unified representation. we currently support
conversions from stabs and dwarf2 formats to the eresi debug format but
also store results of our automatic analysis in there for future consultation.

the main features of the eresi debug format library are :


 * create an uniform format representation for each supported debug format.
 * export types in the eresi engine indicated by debug information.
 * annotate global variables of the analyzed program using their type
   information in the eresi engine.
 * gives function prototypes to etrace.


this package contains the development files provided by libedfmt (the
static library - i.e the .a file - and the libedfmt headers).
