Library for c and fortran mixed programming
	
the cnf package comprises two sets of software which ease the task of writing
portable programs in a mixture of fortran and c. f77 is a set of c macros for
handling the fortran/c subroutine linkage in a portable way, and cnf is a set
of functions to handle the difference between fortran and c character strings,
logical values and pointers to dynamically allocated memory.
