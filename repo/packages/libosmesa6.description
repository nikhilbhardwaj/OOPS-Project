Mesa off-screen rendering extension
	
osmesa is a mesa extension that allows programs to render to an
off-screen buffer using the opengl api without having to create a
rendering context on an x server.  it uses a pure software renderer.

this package provides both 16-bit and 32-bit versions of the off-screen
renderer which do not require external libraries to work.
