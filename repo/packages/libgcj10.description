Java runtime library for use with gcj
	
this is the runtime that goes along with the gcj front end to
gcc. libgcj includes parts of the java class libraries, plus glue to
connect the libraries to the compiler and the underlying os.

to show file names and line numbers in stack traces, the packages
libgcj10-dbg and binutils are required.
