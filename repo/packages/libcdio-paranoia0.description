Library to read digital audio cds with error correction
	
this library is made to read digital audio cds, with error
correction. it does its best to correct errors and jitter that happen
when reading such discs. as it uses libcdio as a backend, it supports
the same kind of cdrom drives (and images) as libcdio.
