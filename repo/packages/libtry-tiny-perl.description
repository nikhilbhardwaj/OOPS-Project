Module providing minimalistic try/catch
	
try::tiny is a perl module that provides bare bones try/catch statements. it
is designed to eliminate common mistakes with eval blocks, and nothing else.

the main focus of this module is to provide simple and reliable error
handling for those having a hard time installing trycatch, but who still want
to write correct eval blocks without 5 lines of boilerplate each time.
