Free clone of tetris, featuring a bastard level
	
bastet (stands for "bastard tetris") is a free (gpl'd) clone of tetris(r)
(built on the top of petris by peter seidler) which is designed to be
"as bastard as possible": it tries to compute how useful blocks are and
gives you the worst, the most bastard it can find. playing bastet can be
a painful experience, especially if you usually make "canyons" and wait for
the long i-shaped block.
