Multimedia plug-in for gecko browsers
	
gecko media player is a browser plug-in that uses gnome mplayer
and mplayer to play media in a browser.
it uses the ns4 api and is therefore compatible with all ns4 derived browsers:
iceweasel, firefox, iceape, epiphany, galeon, midbrowser, xulrunner, etc.

it is the modern replacement for mplayerplug-in (from the same author).
