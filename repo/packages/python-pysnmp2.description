Python snmp library for agents and managers (stable branch)
	
this is a python implementation of snmp v.1/v.2c engine. its general
functionality is to assemble/disassemble snmp messages from/into
given snmp object ids along with associated values. pysnmp also provides
a few transport methods specific to tcp/ip networking.

pysnmp is written entirely in python and is self-sufficient in terms
that it does not rely on any third party tool (it is not a wrapper!).

pysnmp 2.x is the stable branch.
