Simple set of building blocks for unit and runtime testing
	
test::assertions provides a convenient set of tools for constructing tests,
such as unit tests or run-time assertion checks (like c's assert macro).
unlike some of the test:: modules available on cpan, test::assertions is
not limited to unit test scripts; for example it can be used to check if
output is as expected within a benchmarking script.
when it is used for unit tests, it generates output in the standard form
for cpan unit testing (under test::harness).
