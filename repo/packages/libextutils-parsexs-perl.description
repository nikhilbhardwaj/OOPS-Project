Utility to process perl xs code into c code
	
extutils::parsexs is a perl utility that provides a modular way of compiling
perl xs code into appropriate c code by embedding the constructs necessary to
let c functions manipulate perl values and creating the glue necessary to let
perl access those functions.

this module is already included as part of perl's core distribution, so this
package is only beneficial when newer features or bug fixes are required.
