Development library for class library for numbers (c++)
	
cln is a library for computations with all kinds of numbers.  it has a
rich set of number classes, including integers (with unlimited precision),
reals with various precisions (including unlimited), rationals, complex
numbers and polynomials. the kernel is written in assembly language.
it uses garbage  collection (automatic, without imposing any burden on the
main application). many efficient algorithms (i.e. for all transcendental
functions) are implemented.

this package provides header files, a static library plus a manual.
