Ocaml bindings for the bzip2 compression library
	
camlbz2 provides ocaml bindings for libbz2 (aka bzip2), a popular
compression library which typically compresses better (i.e., smaller
resulting files) than gzip.

using camlbz2 you can read and write compressed "files", where files
can be anything offering an in_channel/out_channel abstraction
(files, sockets, ...).

also, with camlbz2 you can compress and decompress strings in memory
using the bzip2 compression algorithm.

this package contains all the development stuff you need to use
camlbz2 in your programs.
