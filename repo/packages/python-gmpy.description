Interfaces gmp to python for fast, unbound-precision computations
	
gmpy is a c-coded python extension module that wraps the gmp library to
provide to python code fast multiprecision arithmetic (integer, rational, and
float), random number generation, advanced number-theoretical functions, and
more.
