Automated driving and testing of terminal-based programs
	
test::expect is a module for automated driving and testing of
terminal-based programs.  it is handy for testing interactive programs
which have a prompt, and is based on the same concepts as the tcl
expect tool.  as in expect::simple, the expect object is made
available for tweaking.

test::expect is intended for use in a test script.
