Fuse based remote filesystem daemon for ltsp thin clients
	
ltspfs is a remote filesystem consisting of two parts:
1) a network server daemon that runs on the ltsp terminal.
2) a fuse module that runs in userspace on the server, that connects with
the daemon on the client.

this package contains the daemon and other binaries to be run on ltsp thin
clients.
