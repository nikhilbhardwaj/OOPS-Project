Odbc binding for ruby1.8
	
odbc is a standard api for connecting to odbc data sources such as relational
database management systems (rdbmss). for accessing odbc data sources from the
ruby language, an odbc binding library and ruby interface are required. this
package provides both for ruby 1.8.

this package includes both utf-8 and non-utf-8 versions.

this is a dummy package, which depends on the package containing the actual
library for the default ruby version.
