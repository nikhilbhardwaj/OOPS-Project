Pixbuf-based theme engine for gtk+ 2.x -- debug symbols
	
sapwood is a pixbuf-based 'theme' that allows you to configure the look of
gtk-using programs. the programs need no modifications to use themes; the
support is built into gtk+.

the engine is similar to the pixbuf engine, but uses client-server design
and pixmaps rather than pixbufs. it is faster and more memory efficient than
the pixbuf engine, but doesn't do scaling or gradients.

this package contains symbol tables for debugging.
