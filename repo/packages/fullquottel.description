Recognizes top-posted e-mail and usenet replies
	
fullquottel performs several tests to determine if a message is written in
the top-post style (a.k.a. "tofu" or jeopardy-style quoting) - the full
response above and a full quote of the original message below.

each test is customizable and has an associated score. fullquottel returns
the total score for the message in several forms which are useful e.g. for
sorting e-mail.
