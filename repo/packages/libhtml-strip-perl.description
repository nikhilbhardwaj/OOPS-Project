Strip html markup from text
	
html::strip simply strips html-like markup from text in a very quick and
brutal manner. it could quite easily be used to strip xml or sgml from text
as well.

it is written in xs, and thus about five times quicker than using regular
expressions for the same task.

it does not do any syntax checking (if you want that, use html::parser)
