Create html versions of cvs logs
	
cvs2html is program that transforms the 'cvs log' output into a
html file.  the program can be used on any type of cvs archive,
but since it invokes cvs itself, it needs to be run in a machine
having a local checked out copy of the archive and access to the
repository.
