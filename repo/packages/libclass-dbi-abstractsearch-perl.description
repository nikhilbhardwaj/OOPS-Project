Abstract class::dbi's sql with sql::abstract
	
class::dbi::abstractsearch is a class::dbi plugin to glue the
sql::abstract module into class::dbi.

class::dbi provides a convenient abstraction layer to a database. it
not only provides a simple database to object mapping layer, but can
be used to implement several higher order database functions, at the
application level, rather than at the database.

sql::abstract provides methods for generating abstract sql from perl
data structures.
