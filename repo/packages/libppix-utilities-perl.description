Perl module containing extensions to ppi
	
this is a collection of functions for dealing with ppi objects, many of which
originated in perl::critic. they are organized into modules by the kind of
ppi class they relate to, by replacing the "ppi" at the front of the module
name with "ppix::utilities", e.g. functionality related to ppi::nodes is in
ppix::utilities::node.
