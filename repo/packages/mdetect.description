Mouse device autodetection tool
	
mdetect is a tool for autoconfiguring mice; it is typically used as the
backend to some user-friendly frontend code.  mdetect writes the autodetected
mouse device and protocol (as used by gpm) to standard output.  it can be
invoked so as to produce output appropriate for xfree86 x server
configuration files.
