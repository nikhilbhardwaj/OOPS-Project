Ruby 1.8 library for merb that provides access to libhaml-ruby
	
haml (html abstraction markup language) is a layer on top of xhtml or
xml that's designed to express the structure of xhtml or xml documents
in a non-repetitive, elegant, easy way, using indentation rather than
closing tags and allowing ruby to be embedded with ease. it was originally
envisioned as a plugin for ruby on rails, but it can function as a
stand-alone templating engine.

this package contains the merb-haml libraries for ruby 1.8.
