Extract, test and view .ace archives (non-free version)
	
the unace utility is used for extracting, testing and viewing the contents of
archives created with the ace archiver.

unlike the unace package which can only extract ace 1.0 archives, the
unace-nonfree package allows to unpack all current ace archives.
