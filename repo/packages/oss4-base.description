Open sound system - base package
	
open sound system (oss) is an attempt in unifying
the digital audio architecture for unix.

this package contains various utilities for configuring
and using oss

for oss to work on a system with a given sound card,
there must be an oss driver for that card in the kernel.
for linux 2.6, a custom oss4-modules package can be built
from the sources in the oss4-source package using
the module-assistant utility.
