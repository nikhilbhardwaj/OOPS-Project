Visualisation tools for the performance co-pilot toolkit
	
the pcp gui package primarily includes visualisation tools for
monitoring systems using live and archived performance co-pilot
(pcp) sources.

these tools have dependencies on graphics libraries which may or
may not be installed on server machines, so pcp gui is delivered,
managed and maintained as a separate (source and binary) package
to the core pcp infrastructure.
