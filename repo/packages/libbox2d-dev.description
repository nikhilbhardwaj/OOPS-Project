2d physics engine - development files
	
2d rigid body simulation library for games. programmers can use it in
their games to make objects move in believable ways and make the world
seem more interactive. from the game's point of view a physics engine is
just a system for procedural animation. rather than paying (or begging)
an animator to move your actors around, you can let sir isaac newton do
the directing.

this package contains the development libraries and headers.
