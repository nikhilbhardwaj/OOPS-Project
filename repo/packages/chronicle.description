Html & rss blog compiler
	
this is a tool which will convert a directory of simple
text files into a static html weblog, (or blog if you prefer).


 the system is intentionally simple, but it supports:



 * rss feed creation.



 * template based output.



 * the tagging of entries.



 * user comments upon entries.
