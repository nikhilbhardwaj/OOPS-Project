Empirical stochastic bandwidth tester
	
bing is a point-to-point bandwidth measurement tool (hence the 'b'),
based on ping.

bing determines the real (raw, as opposed to available or average)
throughput on a link by measuring icmp echo requests' round trip times
for different packet sizes at each end of the link.
