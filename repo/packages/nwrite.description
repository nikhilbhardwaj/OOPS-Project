Enhanced replacement for the write command
	
nwrite is a replacement for the standard write program that lets you write
directly to the terminal of another logged-in user without the overhead of talk
taking over the full screen or the other user having to respond first.

nwrite's advantages over traditional write include the ability to send the same
message simultaneously to multiple users, and a receiver-configurable message
format, including a tag at the start of each line that identifies the sender.
