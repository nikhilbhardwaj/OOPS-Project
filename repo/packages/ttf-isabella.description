The isabella free truetype font
	
this font is called isabella because it is based on the calligraphic
hand used in the isabella breviary, made around 1497, in holland, for
isabella of castille, the first queen of united spain.

it covers all european languages written in the latin script (with
the exception of sami) and covers all iso-8859 with the exception
of the non-latin character sets.
