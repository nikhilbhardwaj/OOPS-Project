Gnu spell, a clone of unix `spell'
	
gnu spell is a spell checking program which prints each misspelled word on a
line of its own. it is designed as a clone of the standard unix `spell'
program, and implemented as a wrapper for ispell. spell accepts as its
arguments a list of files to read from. within that list, the magical file name
`-' causes spell to read from standard input. in addition, when called with no
file name arguments, spell assumes that it should process standard input.
