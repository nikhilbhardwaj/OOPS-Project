Xen/lvm2 based testbed snapshot system
	
machinery for setting up a xen domain which can be resumed over and
over again, discarding changes made each time.  this can be useful
for automated testing and other advanced techniques; autopkgtest is
able to make use of this machinery for its virtualisation needs.

you will need a working xen setup to make use of this software.  your
network administrator will need to provide support for the testbeds'
networking requirements.  see the readme for documentation.
