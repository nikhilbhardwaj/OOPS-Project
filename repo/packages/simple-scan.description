Simple scanning utility
	
simple scan is an easy-to-use application, designed to let users
connect their scanner and quickly have the image/document in an
appropriate format.

simple scan is basically a frontend for sane - which is the same
backend as xsane uses. this means that all existing scanners will
work and the interface is well tested.
