Development files for the librdmacm library
	
librdmacm is a library that allows applications to set up reliable
connected and unreliable datagram transfers when using rdma adapters.
it provides a transport-neutral interface in the sense that the same
code can be used for both infiniband and iwarp adapters.  the
interface is based on sockets, but adapted for queue pair (qp) based
semantics: communication must use a specific rdma device, and data
transfers are message-based.

librdmacm only provides communication management (connection setup
and tear-down) and works in conjunction with the verbs interface
provided by libibverbs, which provides the interface used to actually
transfer data.

this package is needed to compile programs against librdmacm1.
it contains the header files and static libraries (optionally)
needed for compiling.
