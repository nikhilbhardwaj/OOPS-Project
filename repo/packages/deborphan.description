Program that can find unused packages, e.g. libraries
	
deborphan finds "orphaned" packages on your system. it determines which
packages have no other packages depending on their installation and shows
you a list of these packages. it is most useful when finding libraries,
but it can be used on packages in all sections.

this package also includes orphaner, a text menu frontend to deborphan.
please install the recommended packages dialog, gettext-base and apt when
you want a working and fully featured orphaner.
