C++ library and application server for web applications [development]
	
wt (pronounced 'witty') is a c++ library and application server for
developing and deploying web applications. the api is widget-centric
and offers complete abstraction of any web-specific application details.

this package contains the development files for the wt core library but you
still need to install a connector, either the http connector (libwthttp-dev)
or the fastcgi connector (libwtfcgi-dev).
