The multiboot specification
	
this specification, created in 1995, describes a method of loading various
multiboot kernels using a single compliant boot loader (such as gnu grub)
on i386-based computers.

it is used by a variety of kernel images, such as the hurd, xen, or netbsd
kernels.

an example implementation of a multiboot kernel is provided.

for an example implementation of a multiboot loader, check grub legacy
(grub-legacy package), or grub 2 (grub-pc package, and others).
