Smpeg gtk+ mpeg audio/video player
	
smpeg (sdl mpeg player library) is a free mpeg1 video player library with
sound support.  video playback is based on the ubiquitous berkeley mpeg
player, mpeg_play v2.2.  audio is played through a slightly modified
mpegsound library, part of splay v0.8.2. smpeg supports mpeg audio (mp3),
mpeg-1 video, and mpeg system streams.

this package contains a gtk+ player called gtv.
