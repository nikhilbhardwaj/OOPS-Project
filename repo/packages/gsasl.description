Gnu sasl command line utility
	
gnu sasl is an implementation of the simple authentication and
security layer framework and a few common sasl mechanisms. sasl is
used by network servers (e.g., imap, smtp) to request authentication
from clients, and in clients to authenticate against servers.

this package contains the gnu sasl command line tool and the
gnu sasl manual.
