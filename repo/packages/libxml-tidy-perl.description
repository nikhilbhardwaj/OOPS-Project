Perl module for tidy indenting of xml documents
	
xml::tidy creates xml document objects (with inheritance from xml::xpath) to
tidy mixed-content (ie. non-data) text node indenting. there are also some
other handy member functions to compress && expand your xml document object
(into either a compact xml representation or a binary one).
