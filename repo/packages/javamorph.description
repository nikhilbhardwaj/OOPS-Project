Java morphing film-make program for pixel picture-input
	
give two human-face pictures as inputs into the program. then mark
important locations whithin both faces by pairs of corresponding points.
the program will create a short enumerated picture series in which the left
face moves (morphs) into the right one. you can then create a mpeg (see
mencoder) from the picture series. an animated gif (see gimp) is also
possible.
