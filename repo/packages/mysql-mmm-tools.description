Multi-master replication manager for mysql - tools
	
mmm (master-master replication manager for mysql) is a set of flexible scripts
to perform monitoring/failover and management of mysql master-master
replication configurations (with only one node writable at any time).
the toolset also has the ability to read balance standard master/slave
configurations with any number of slaves, so you can use it to move virtual
ip addresses around a group of servers depending on whether they are behind
in replication.

this package includes the mmm tools mmm_backup, mmm_restore and mmm_clone.
