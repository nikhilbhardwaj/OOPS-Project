Stringtemplate templating engine for java
	
stringtemplate is a java template engine for generating source code,
web pages, emails, or any other formatted text output. stringtemplate
is particularly good at multi-targeted code generators, multiple site
skins, and internationalization/localization.

its distinguishing characteristic is that it strictly enforces
model-view separation unlike other engines.
