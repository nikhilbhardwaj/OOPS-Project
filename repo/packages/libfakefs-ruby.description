A fake file system to be used in unit tests
	
fakefs allows you to unit-test file system calls without actually touching the
file system. file, dir and fileutils calls are redirected to a fake file system
without requiring to use any mocking library thus making it faster and easier
to test file system calls.

this is a dependency package, which depends on a libfakefs package
built for the default ruby version.
