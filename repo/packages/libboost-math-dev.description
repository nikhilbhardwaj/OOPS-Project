Boost.math library development files (default version)
	
this package forms part of the boost c++ libraries collection.

this library is divided into three interconnected parts:

 * statistical distributions: provides a reasonably comprehensive set of
   statistical distributions, upon which higher level statistical tests
   can be built.
 * mathematical special functions: provides a small number of high quality
   special functions, initially these were concentrated on functions used in
   statistical applications along with those in the technical report on
   c++ library extensions.
 * implementation toolkit: provides many of the tools required to implement
   mathematical special functions.


this package is a dependency package, which depends on debian's default
boost version (currently 1.42).
