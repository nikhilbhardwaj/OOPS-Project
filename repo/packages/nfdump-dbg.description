Netflow capture daemon tools compiled with debugging symbols
	
collects and processes netflow data with command line tools. collected netflow
data is stored in filesystem and is limited by available storage space only.
tools are optimized for speed and filtering. nfcapd reads netflow v5, v7 and
v9 flows transparently. you need one nfcapd process for each netflow stream.
optional support for sflow and flow-tools to nfdump conversion utilities are
available but needs re-compiliation.
