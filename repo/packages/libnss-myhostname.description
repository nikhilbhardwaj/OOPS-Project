Nss module providing falback resolution for the current hostname
	
this package contains a plugin for the name service switch, providing host
name resolution for the locally configured system hostname as returned by
gethostname(2). it simply returns the ipv4 address 127.0.1.1 (which is on the
local loopback) and the ipv6 address ::1 (which is the local host).

a lot of software relies on that the local host name is resolvable. this
package provides an alternative to the fragile and error-prone manual editing
of /etc/hosts.
