Dns configuration checker (web interface)
	
dns is a critical resource for every network application, so it is
quite important to ensure that a zone or domain name is correctly
configured in the dns.

zonecheck is intended to help solving misconfigurations or
inconsistencies usually revealed by an increase in the latency of the
application, up to the output of unexpected/inconsistant results.

this package is the cgi version, for the web.
