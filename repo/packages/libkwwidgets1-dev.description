Cross-platform gui toolkit - development
	
like many other gui toolkits, it provides low-level core widgets
like buttons, entries, scales, menus, combo-boxes, thumbwheels,
spin-boxes, trees, notebooks and multi-column lists to name a few.
unlike many of those toolkits though, it also provides advanced
composite widgets like toolbars, tooltips, progress gauges,
split-frames, splash-screens, 2d/3d extents, color pickers,
histograms, windows and dialogs.

this package contains developer files for kwwidgets
