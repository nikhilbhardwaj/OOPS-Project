Translates wiki formatted text into other formats
	
the original wiki web site was intended to have a very simple interface to
edit and to add pages. its formatting rules are simple and easy to use. they
are also easily translated into other, more complicated markup languages with
this module. it creates html by default, but can be extended to produce valid
pod, docbook, xml, or any other format imaginable.
