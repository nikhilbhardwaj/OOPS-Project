Free objects for xtallography
	
fox is a program for the ab initio structure determination from powder
diffraction (neutrons, x-ray). the crystal structure can be described as any
combination of atoms, molecules or polyhedras, without a priori information
about the connectivity of these 'building block'. fox can make multi-pattern
global optimizations, and automatically correct special positions.

fox could also be used for educational purposes, to display crystal
structures in 3d with the associated powder diffraction pattern.
