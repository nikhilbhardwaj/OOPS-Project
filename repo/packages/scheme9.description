Scheme 9 from empty space r4rs scheme interpreter
	
scheme 9 from empty space is an interpreter for a broad subset of
r4rs scheme, and runs in many popular environments, including
linux, *bsd, the unmentionable horror, and plan 9.  the s9fes code
strives to be simple and comprehensible.  it is particularly
interesting to people who want to (a) try scheme without having to
jump through too many hoops (s9fes is very portable); or (b) study
the implementation of scheme (in a language other than scheme).  a
free online textbook describing the system is also available.
