Python db api 2.0 extension for firebird and interbase
	
kinterbasdb implements python database api 2.0-compliant support
for the open source relational database firebird and some
versions of its proprietary cousin borland interbase(r).

in addition to the minimal feature set of the standard python db
api, kinterbasdb also exposes nearly the entire native client
api of the atabase engine.
