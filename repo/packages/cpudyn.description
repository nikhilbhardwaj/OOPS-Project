Cpu dynamic frequency control for processors with scaling
	
cpudyn controls the speed in intel speedstep, pentium 4 mobile,
amd powernow, powerpc, crusoe longrun machines with the cpufreq compiled
in the kernel, or with machines that support acpi throttling. it saves
battery, lowers temperature, and can put the computer disks in standby
mode if a given period has passed without any i/o operation. it works
well even with journaled file systems such as ext3, xfs, or reiserfs.
even supports the new interface for kernels 2.6.x
