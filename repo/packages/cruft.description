Find any cruft built up on your system
	
cruft is a program to look over your system for anything that shouldn't
be there, but is; or for anything that should be there, but isn't.

it bases most of its results on dpkg's database, as well as a list of
`extra files' that can appear during the lifetime of various packages.

cruft is still in pre-release; your assistance in improving its accuracy
and performance is appreciated.
