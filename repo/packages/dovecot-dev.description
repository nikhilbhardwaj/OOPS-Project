Header files for the dovecot mail server
	
dovecot is a mail server whose major goals are security and extreme
reliability. it tries very hard to handle all error conditions and verify
that all data is valid, making it nearly impossible to crash. it should
also be pretty fast, extensible, and portable.

this package contains header files needed to compile plugins for the
dovecot mail server.
