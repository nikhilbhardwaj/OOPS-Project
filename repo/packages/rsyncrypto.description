Rsync friendly encryption
	
rsyncrypto allows you to encrypt a file or a directory structure, such that
they can later be synchronized to another machine using rsync. this means
that local changes to the plain text file result in local changes to the
cipher text file.

rsyncrypto compresses the plain text file prior to encrypting it.
