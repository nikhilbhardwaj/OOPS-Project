Loads flat data files into postgresql
	
pgloader imports data from flat files and insert it into a database
table. you have to provide a configuration file containing sections,
which each defines how to load a table. csv and text format are
supported, the former is able to import mysql dumps when -t is used,
the latter is able to parse multi-line non-quoted with trailing
delimiter quite csv input, such as given by informix unload.
