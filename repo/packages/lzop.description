Fast compression program
	
lzop is a compressor similar to gzip.  its main advantages over gzip are
much higher compression and decompression speed.  lzop was designed with
the following goals in mind:

 1) reliability
 2) speed (both compression and decompression)
 3) reasonable drop-in compatibility with gzip
 4) portability
