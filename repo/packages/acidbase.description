Basic analysis and security engine
	
base is based on the code from the analysis console for intrusion databases
(acid) project. this application provides a web front-end to query and analyze
the alerts coming from a snort ids system.

base is a web interface to perform analysis of intrusions that snort has
detected on your network. it uses a user authentication and role-base system,
so that you as the security admin can decide what and how much information
each user can see.
