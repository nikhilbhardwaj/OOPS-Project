Perl module that encodes integers into a short "locator string"
	
number::recordlocator encodes integers into a 32 character "alphabet"
designed to be short and easy to read and pronounce. the encoding maps:


    0 to o
    1 to i
    s to f
    b to p


with a 32 bit encoding, you can map 33.5 million unique ids into a 5
character code.
