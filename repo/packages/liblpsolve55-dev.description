Solve (mixed integer) linear programming problems - library
	
the linear programming (lp) problem can be formulated as: solve a.x >=
v1, with v2.x maximal. a is a matrix, x is a vector of (nonnegative)
variables, v1 is a vector called the right hand side, and v2 is a vector
specifying the objective function.

an integer linear programming (ilp) problem is an lp with the
constraint that all the variables are integers.  in a mixed integer
linear programming (milp) problem, some of the variables are integer
and others are real.

the program lp_solve solves lp, ilp, and milp problems. it is slightly
more general than suggested above, in that every row of a (specifying
one constraint) can have its own (in)equality, <=, >= or =. the result
specifies values for all variables.

lp_solve uses the 'simplex' algorithm and sparse matrix methods for
pure lp problems.  if one or more of the variables is declared
integer, the simplex algorithm is iterated with a branch and bound
algorithm, until the desired optimal solution is found.  lp_solve can
read mps format input files.

this package contains the static library for developing programs using
liblpsolve.
