Perl implementation of readline libraries
	
term::readline::perl is a quick implementation of the minimal interface to
readline libraries. the implementation is made in perl (mostly) by jeffrey
friedl. the only thing this library does is to make it conformant (and add
some minimal changes, like using term::readkey if present, and correct work
under xterm).
