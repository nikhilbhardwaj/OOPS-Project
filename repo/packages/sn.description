Small nntp server for leaf sites
	
sn is a small news system for small sites serving perhaps a few
dozen newsgroups, and with a slow connection to the internet.
it is similar to leafnode (ftp.troll.no, by arnt gulbrandsen).
the target user is a home or soho with a single modem connection
to the internet, maybe running ip masq or similar, and serving a
few workstations.
