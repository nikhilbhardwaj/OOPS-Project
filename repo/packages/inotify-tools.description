inotify-tools is a set of command-line programs for linux providing a
simple interface to inotify. these programs can be used to monitor and
act upon filesystem events. inotify-tools consists of two utilities:

inotifywait simply blocks for inotify events, making it appropriate
for use in shell scripts.

inotifywatch collects filesystem usage statistics and outputs counts
of each inotify event.
