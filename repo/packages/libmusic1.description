Multi-simulation coordinator for mpi -- runtime library
	
music allows spike events and continuous time series to be
communicated between parallel applications within the same mpi job in
a cluster computer.  typical usage cases are connecting models
developed for different simulators and connecting a parallel
simulator to a post-processing tool.

this package contains the music library.
