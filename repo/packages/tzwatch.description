Displays time and date in specified time zones on console
	
this shell script displays the time and date of time zones specified by the
user.  the time zones may be entered by hand in tz format or chosen from a
list prepared from /usr/share/zoneinfo/zone.tab.  the zone list is kept in a
format consistent with the gtk+ application gworldclock.
