A lightweight rpc library based on xml and http for c and c++
	
xml-rpc is a quick-and-easy way to make procedure calls over the internet.
it converts the procedure call into an xml document, sends it to a remote
server using http, and gets back the response as xml.

this library provides a modular implementation of xml-rpc for c and c++.
