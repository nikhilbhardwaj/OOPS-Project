Postgresql config tuner
	
pgtune works by taking an existing postgresql.conf file as an input,
making changes to it based on the amount of ram in your server and
suggested workload, and output a new file.

pgtune will add a set of configuration values at the end of the
output file.

pgtune will set values for variables like maintenance_work_mem,
effective_cache_size, work_mem, wal_buffers, checkpoint_segments,
shared_buffers or max_connections
