Small port-knock daemon
	
a port-knock server that listens to all traffic on a given network
interface (only ethernet and ppp are currently supported), looking for
a special "knock" sequences of port-hits. a remote system
makes these port-hits by sending a tcp (or udp) packet to a port on the
server. when the server detects a specific sequence of port-hits, it
runs a command defined in its configuration file. this can be used to
open up holes in a firewall for quick access.
