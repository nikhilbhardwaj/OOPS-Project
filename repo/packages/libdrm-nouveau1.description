Userspace interface to nouveau-specific kernel drm services -- runtime
	
this library implements the userspace interface to the nouveau-specific kernel
drm services. drm stands for "direct rendering manager", which is the
kernelspace portion of the "direct rendering infrastructure" (dri). the dri is
currently used on linux to provide hardware-accelerated opengl drivers.
