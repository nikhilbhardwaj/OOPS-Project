Graphics library for 3dfx voodoo based cards - shared libraries
	
this package allows you to use the 3d functions of cards based on
3dfx interactive, inc's voodoo banshee, voodoo 3, voodoo 4, and
voodoo 5 chipsets.
you should install it if you use such a card.

this package does not need the 3dfx kernel driver, as it uses dri instead.
