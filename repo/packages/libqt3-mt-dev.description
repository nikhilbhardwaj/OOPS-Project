Qt development files (threaded)
	
qt is a c++ class library optimized for graphical user interface
development. this package contains the libqt-mt.so symlink, necessary
for building threaded qt applications as well as the libqui.so symlink
and the necessary header files for libqui.so. (see readme.debian and
the qt documentation for instructions on libqui.so)

warning: if you plan to build some older qt3 applications, you will
most probably have to install the libqt3-compat-headers package. it
contains all the headers which are not part of the official qt3 api
anymore but which are still used by some programs. so if you encounter
problems with missing header files, please install this package first
before you send a bugreport.
