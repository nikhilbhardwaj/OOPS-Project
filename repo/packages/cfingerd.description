Configurable finger daemon
	
this is a free replacement for standard finger daemons such as gnu
fingerd and mit fingerd.  cfingerd can enable/disable finger services
to individual users, rather than to all users on a given host.  it is
able to respond to a finger request to a specified user by running a
shell script (e.g., finger doorbell@mysite.mydomain might cause a
sound file to be sent) rather than just a plain text file.
