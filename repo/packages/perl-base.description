Minimal perl system
	
perl is a scripting language used in many system scripts and utilities.

this package provides a perl interpreter and the small subset of the
standard run-time library required to perform basic tasks. for a full
perl installation, install "perl" (and its dependencies, "perl-modules"
and "perl-doc").
