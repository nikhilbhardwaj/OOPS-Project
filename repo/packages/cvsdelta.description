Summarize differences in a cvs repository
	
cvsdelta summarizes the difference between a cvs project and its
local version. it detects files that have been added and removed, and
of existing files it counts the number of lines that have been added,
deleted, and changed. it filters project changes by using .cvsignore
files, both system-wide and locally.
