Gromacs molecular dynamics sim, development kit
	
gromacs is a versatile package to perform molecular dynamics, i.e. simulate
the newtonian equations of motion for systems with hundreds to millions of
particles.

it is primarily designed for biochemical molecules like proteins and lipids
that have a lot of complicated bonded interactions, but since gromacs is
extremely fast at calculating the nonbonded interactions (that usually
dominate simulations) many groups are also using it for research on non-
biological systems, e.g. polymers.

this package contains header files and static libraries for development
purposes, plus sample makefiles.  development components for mpi-enabled
builds are contained within the gromacs-mpich and gromacs-lam packages.
