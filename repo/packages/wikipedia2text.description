Displays wikipedia articles on the command line
	
this script fetches wikipedia articles (currently supports around 30
wikipedia languages) and displays them as plain text in a pager or
just sends the text to standard out. alternatively it opens the
wikipedia article in a (possibly gui) web browser or just shows the
url of the appropriate wikipedia article.
