Point-to-point protocol (ppp) - development files
	
the point-to-point protocol provides a standard way to transmit
datagrams over a serial link, as well as a standard way for the machines
at either end of the link to negotiate various optional characteristics
of the link.

this package provides files needed to build pppd-related software.
