Extensible x user interface for mh mail
	
exmh uses the regular mh programs to manipulate your mail folders and
messages.  this means it is compatible with command-line use of mh
programs, and its actions should be familiar if you are an experienced
mh user.  if you are a new mh user, then the details of running mh
programs are hidden behind the graphical interface.
