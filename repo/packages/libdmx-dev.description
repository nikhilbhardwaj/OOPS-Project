X11 distributed multihead extension library (development headers)
	
libdmx is an interface to the dmx extension for x, which allows a single
server to be set up as a proxy spanning multiple servers -- not unlike
xinerama across discrete physical machines.  it can be reconfigured
on the fly to change the layout, and it is presented as a single logical
display to clients.

libdmx allows clients to configure the layout of dmx servers by adding
and removing screens, input devices, et al.

this package contains the development headers for the library found in
libdmx1.  non-developers likely have little use for this package.
