Tool for building debian binary packages from debian sources
	
the sbuild suite of programs (wanna-build, buildd and sbuild) are
used to build binary packages from source packages.  the wanna-build
database tracks packages which require building; buildd schedules
work from information it gets from the wanna-build database; sbuild
does the actual package building.

this package contains the core library modules used by these
programs.
