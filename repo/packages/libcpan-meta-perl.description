Perl module to access distribution metadata for a cpan distribution
	
software distributions released to the cpan include a meta.json or, for older
distributions, meta.yml which describes the distribution, its contents, and
the requirements for building and installing the distribution. the data
structure stored in the meta.json file is described in cpan::meta::spec.

cpan::meta provides a simple class to represent this distribution metadata
(or distmeta), along with some helpful methods for interrogating that data.
