Python parsing module
	
the parsing module is an alternative approach to creating and
executing simple grammars, vs. the traditional lex/yacc approach, or
the use of regular expressions.  the parsing module provides a
library of classes that client code uses to construct the grammar
directly in python code.

here's an example:


 from pyparsing import word, alphas
 greet = word(alphas) + "," + word(alphas) + "!"
 hello = "hello, world!"
 print hello, "->", greet.parsestring(hello)
