3d client of the worldforge project
	
ember is a client framework for worldforge. it's not meant to be a
standalone game, instead its purpose is to provide a solid and extensible
base from which to build game-specific clients. one of the goals of ember
is to allow for easy customization of the codebase. currently it supports
the game world of mason.
