Wxbase library (development) - non-gui support classes of wxwidgets toolkit
	
wxbase is a collection of c++ classes providing basic data structures
(strings, lists, arrays), powerful wxdatetime class for date manipulations,
portable wrappers around many os-specific functions allowing to build the
same program under all supported folders, wxthread class for writing
multithreaded programs using either win32 or posix threads and much more.
wxbase currently supports the following platforms: generic unix (linux,
freebsd, solaris, hp-ux, ...), win32, and beos.

this package provides the files needed to compile apps using the wxbase
library.
