X cursor management library (unstripped)
	
this package provides an unstripped shared object with debugging symbols,
useful to provide a backtrace with symbol names in a debugger; this
facilitates interpretation of core dumps, and aids in finding logic errors in
programs using this library (or the library itself).  the library is
installed in /usr/lib/debug and can be used by placing that directory in the
ld_library_path environment variable when the code to be debugged is
executed.  non-programmers will likely have little use for this package.
