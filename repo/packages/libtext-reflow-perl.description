Perl module for reflowing files using knuth's algorithm
	
text::reflow provides a series of utilities that reflow paragraphs in a given
file, filehandle, string or array using knuth's paragraphing algorithm (as
used in tex) to pick the optimal places to break lines. the reflow algorithm
tries to keep lines the same length but also tries to break at punctuation,
and to avoid breaking within a proper name or after certain connectives. the
result is more readable since fewer phrases are broken across line breaks.
