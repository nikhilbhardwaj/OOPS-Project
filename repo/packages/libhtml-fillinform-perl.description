Populates html forms with data
	
this module automatically inserts data from a previous html form into
the html input, textarea, radio buttons, checkboxes and select
tags. it is a subclass of html::parser and uses it to parse the html
and insert the values into the form tags.

one useful application is after a user submits an html form without
filling out a required field.  html::fillinform can be used to
redisplay the html form with all the form elements containing the
submitted info.
