Module for automatic text wrapping and reformatting
	
text::autoformat provides intelligent formatting of plain text without the
need for any kind of embedded mark-up. the module recognizes internet
quoting conventions, a wide range of bullet and number schemes, centered
text, and block quotations, and reformats each appropriately. other options
allow the user to adjust inter-word and inter-paragraph spacing, justify
text, and impose various capitalization schemes.
