Quickly creating backups of mysql server's data files
	
to perform a backup, mylvmbackup obtains a read lock on all tables and
flushes all server caches to disk, makes an lvm snapshot of the volume
containing the mysql data directory, and unlocks the tables again. the
snapshot process takes only a small amount of time. when it is done, the
server can continue normal operations, while the actual file backup
proceeds.
