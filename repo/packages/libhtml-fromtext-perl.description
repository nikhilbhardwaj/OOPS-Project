Mark up text as html
	
this is the cpan perl module html::fromtext.

the html::fromtext module marks up plain text as html.  by default it converts
html metacharacters into the corresponding entities.  more sophisticated
transformations, such as splitting the text into paragraphs or marking up
bulleted lists, can be carried out by setting the appropriate options.
