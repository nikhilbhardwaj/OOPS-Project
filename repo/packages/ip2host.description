Resolve ips to hostnames in web server logs
	
this script is a drop-in replacement for the logresolve.pl
script distributed with the apache web server.

ip2host has the same basic design of forking children to handle
the dns resolution in parallel, but multiplexes the communication
to minimize the impact of slow responses.  this results in a
significant speed improvement (approximately 10x faster), and
the performance degrades more gracefully as the dns timeout value
is increased.
