Perl module providing a set::object type
	
moosex::types::set::object provides moose type constraint (see moosex::types
and moose::util::typeconstraints) that is a set::object, with coercions. it
is essentially a collection of unordered objects without duplication (see
set theory in mathematics).

similarly, it allows one to operate on these sets - determining their union,
intersection, difference and symmetric difference in a trivial way. there are
many more operations, which are discussed in set::object's documentation.
