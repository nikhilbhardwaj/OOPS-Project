A flexible and efficient ftp daemon
	
muddleftpd has been designed from the ground up to be efficient,
configurable and to be tolerant of being run in root or non-root mode.
this server enables users to set up a variety of configurations, from
a traditional ftp server using the password file for everything, to
using the password file for nothing running entirely as a single
user.

modules for smb, mysql and mud authentication included in the package.
