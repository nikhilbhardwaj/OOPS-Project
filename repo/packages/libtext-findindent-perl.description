Module to heuristically determine indentation style
	
text::findindent is a perl module that attempts to detect the underlying
indentation "policy" for a text file (most likely a source code file). you
give it a chunk of text, and it tells you if tabs, spaces or combination of
both are used for indentation.

it honours vim midelines and emacs local variables settings.
