Simple, transparent data interface, with caching
	
data::objectdriver is an object relational mapper, meaning that it maps
object-oriented design concepts onto a relational database.

it's inspired by, and descended from, the mt::objectdriver classes in
six apart's movable type and typepad weblogging products. but it adds in
caching and partitioning layers, allowing you to spread data across
multiple physical databases, without your application code needing to
know where the data is stored.
