X11 font rasterisation library with xprint support (development headers)
	
libxfont provides various services for x servers, most notably font
selection and rasterisation (through external libraries).

this package contains the development headers for the library found in
libxfont1.  non-developers likely have little use for this package.

libxfontp (libxfont v1.3) provides support for xprint.  normal developers
should use libxfont-dev instead of libxfontp-dev.
