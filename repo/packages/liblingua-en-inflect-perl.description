Perl module to pluralize english words
	
lingua::en::inflect is a perl module which can pluralize words in english. it
handles the special cases, and support nouns, verbs, and adjectives. it can
also pick between "a" and "an" based on pronunciation of a word and compare
words in a "number-insensitive" manner.

lingua::en::inflect follows the oxford english dictionary and the guidelines
in fowler's modern english usage, preferring the former where they disagree.
both british and american english are supported.
