Field-theory motivated computer algebra system
	
cadabra is a computer algebra system designed specifically for the
solution of problems encountered in field theory. it has extensive
functionality for tensor polynomial simplification including
multi-term symmetries, fermions and anti-commuting variables,
clifford algebras and fierz transformations, implicit coordinate
dependence, multiple index types and many more. the input format is
a subset of tex.
