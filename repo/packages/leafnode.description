Nntp server for small sites
	
leafnode is a news server suitable for small, limited-bandwidth sites
with only a few users ('leaf' sites). it keeps track of which groups
are being read, and downloads only articles in those groups. leafnode
has been designed to require no maintenance and to be easy to set up.

perl is required to use some optional features of the package for
handling very low volume newsgroups.
