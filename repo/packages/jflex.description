Lexical analyzer generator for java
	
it is also a rewrite of the very useful tool jlex which was developed
by elliot berk at princeton university. as vern paxon states for
his c/c++ tool flex : they do not share any code though.

jflex is designed to work together with the lalr parser generator cup
by scott hudson, and the java modification of berkeley yacc byacc/j
by bob jamison. it can also be used together with other parser generators
like antlr or as a standalone tool.
