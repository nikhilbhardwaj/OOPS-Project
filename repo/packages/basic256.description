children the basics of computer programming. it uses traditional
control structures like gosub, for/next, and goto, which helps kids
easily see how program flow-control works. it has a built-in graphics
mode which lets them draw pictures on screen in minutes, and a set
of detailed, easy-to-follow tutorials that introduce programming
concepts through fun exercises.
