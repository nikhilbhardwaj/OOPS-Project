Python-like language and compiler for the cli
	
boo is an object oriented statically typed programming language
for the common language infrastructure (cli) with a python inspired
syntax and a special focus on language and compiler extensibility.

this package contains the boo compiler, interpreter and interactive shell.
the boo compiler and the programs it produces are 100% common intermediate
language (cil) bytecode and can therefore be run on any compliant cli virtual
machine.
