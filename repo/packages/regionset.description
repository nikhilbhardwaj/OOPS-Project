View and modify the region code of dvd drives
	
regionset is a small utility which displays and sets
the region/zone setting of a dvd drive, allowing it to decrypt
the dvd's sold in this geographical zone. hardware vendors
often limit the number of such modifications, but it is
necessary to set it at least once with a brand new drive.
