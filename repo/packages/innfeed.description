This is the inn feeder program `innfeed.'
	
this is a program that sends a newsfeed to one or more remote hosts
through nntp. it can handle multiple connections to multiple remote
hosts. it is an alternative to `nntplink' (of which there is no
debian package) or the inn-provided `send-nntp' (which is slow).
