Tiny/turbo/throttling http server
	
thttpd is a small, fast secure webserver. it features cgi support,
url-traffic-based throttling and basic authentication. thttpd has a very small
memory footprint as it only forks itself in order to execute cgi scripts. it is
designed to be as fast as fully featured web-servers and it performs extremely
well under high load.

this package contains the thttpd server. for thttpd support programs see the
thttpd-util package.
