A very small editor
	
this package contains an editor you can call via the following links:

  - e3em: emacs-like key bindings
  - e3vi: vi-like key bindings
  - e3pi: pico-like key bindings
  - e3ne: nedit-like key bindings
  - e3ws: wordstar-like key bindings


e3 has the following advantages over other editors:

  - it has no library dependencies
  - one very small binary (only 10 kb) that gives you 5 editors
