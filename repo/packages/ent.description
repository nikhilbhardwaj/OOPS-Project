Pseudorandom number sequence test program
	
this program applies various tests to sequences of bytes stored in
files and reports the results of those tests. the program is useful
for those evaluating pseudorandom number generators for encryption and
statistical sampling applications, compression algorithms, and other
applications where the information density of a file is of interest.
