Japanese gothic and mincho font from "misaki" bitmap font
	
originally, misaki font was created as japanese 8x8 bitmap font for small
computer pc-e500, so it was small, beautiful and easily readable font.
and now, it is converted to truetype font.

it's beta quality yet, but useful for some situation.
