Quite universal circuit simulator
	
qucs is an integrated circuit simulator which means you are able
to setup a circuit with a graphical user interface (gui) and simulate
the large-signal, small-signal and noise behaviour of the circuit.
after that simulation has finished you can view the simulation
results on a presentation page or window.
