Multi-tabbed gtk/vte terminal emulator
	
roxterm is a terminal emulator based on the vte library. it was originally
intended to be a lightweight alternative to gnome-terminal, but its role has
shifted to providing a richer range of features for power users. it can be used
as a rox application, as the name implies, but also integrates well with other
x desktop environments such as gnome.
