Module for lightweight, universal variable exporting
	
universal::exports is an alternative to the perl exporter module, providing a
universal, lightweight subset of its functionality. it uses exporter::lite
(see libexporter-lite-perl for details).

historically, this module provided universal::require, which has become an
independent distribution. for reasons of backward compatibility, this package
depends on libuniversal-require-perl.
