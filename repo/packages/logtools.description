Russell's misc tools for managing log files.
	
clfmerge - merge common-log-format web logs in order without sorting (good for
when you have a gig of logs).

logprn - like "tail -f" but after a specified time period of inactivity will
run a program (such as lpr) and pipe the new data to it)

funnel - pipe one stream of data to several files or processes.

clfsplit - split clf format web logs by client ip address.

clfdomainsplit - split clf logs by server domain.
