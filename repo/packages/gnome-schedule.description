Gnome scheduler for automatic tasks
	
gnome gui for configuring a users' cron (automatic jobs).

some of its features are:

   again and again.
 * if run as root, you can edit any user's crontab and "at" tasks.
 * human-readable strings like "every hour" instead of "0 * * * *".
 * advanced mode for crontab experts.
 * a calendar allows you to choose the day you want a task executed.
