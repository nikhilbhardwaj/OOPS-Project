Pop3 and imap4 proxy server
	
perdition allows users to connect to a content-free pop3 or imap4
server that will redirect them to their real pop3 or imap4 server. this
enables mail retrieval for a domain to be split across multiple backend
servers on a per user basis. this can also be used to as a pop3 or imap4
proxy especially in firewall applications. perdition supports arbitrary
library based map access to determine the server for a user. posix
regular expression, gdbm, berkeley db, mysql, postgresql, odbc and ldap
libraries ship with the distribution.
