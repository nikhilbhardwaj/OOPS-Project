Module providing access to svnlook data
	
svn::look is a simple perl module that provides a object-oriented wrapper
around subversion's svnlook command, with built-in caching to improve speed.
it is useful to gather information about a repository, its revisions and its
transactions, which makes it easy for hook writers to retrieve and use the
information they need.
