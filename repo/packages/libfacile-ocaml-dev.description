Functional constraint library implemented in objective caml
	
facile is a constraint programming library over integer finite domain
written in objective caml. it offers all usual facilities to create
and manipulate finite domain variables, arithmetic expressions and
constraints (possibly non-linear), built-in global constraints and
search goals. facile allows as well to build easily user-defined
constraints and goals (including recursive ones), making pervasive use
of ocaml higher-order functionals to provide a simple and flexible
interface for the user. as facile is an ocaml library and not "yet
another language", the user benefits from type inference and strong
typing discipline, high level of abstraction, modules and objects
system, as well as native code compilation efficiency, garbage
collection and replay debugger, all features of ocaml (among many
others) that allow to prototype and experiment quickly: modeling, data
processing and interface are implemented with the same powerful and
efficient language.
