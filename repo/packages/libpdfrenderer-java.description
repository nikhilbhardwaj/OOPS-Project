Java pdf renderer and viewer
	
the pdf renderer is just what the name implies: an open source, all
java library which renders pdf documents to the screen using java2d.
typically this means drawing into a swing panel, but it could also draw
to other graphics2d implementations. it could be used to draw on top of
pdfs, share them over a network, convert pdfs to png images, or maybe
even project pdfs into a 3d scene.
