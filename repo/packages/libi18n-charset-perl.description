Perl module for mapping character set names to iana names
	
i18n::charset maps character set names to the names officially
registered with iana.  for example, 'shift_jis' is the official name
of 'x-sjis'.

it also maps character set names to unicode::map, unicode::map8, and
unicode::maputf8 conversion scheme names (if those modules are
installed).  for example, the unicode::map8 scheme name for
'windows-1251' is 'cp1251'.
