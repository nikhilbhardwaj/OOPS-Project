Produces dvi, postscript, pdf documents from docbook sources
	
docbook to latex publishing that transforms your sgml/xml docbook documents to
dvi, postscript or pdf by translating them in pure latex as a first process.
mathml 2.0 markups are supported, too.  it originally started as a clone of
db2latex, but has been enhanced extensively since then and is actively
maintained by the upstream author.
