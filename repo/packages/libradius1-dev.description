/bin/login replacement with radius. header file and link lib
	
radiusclient is a /bin/login replacement  which gets called by a getty
to log  in a user and  to setup the user's  login environment.  normal
login programs just  check the login name and  password which the user
entered  against the local  password file  (/etc/passwd, /etc/shadow).
in  contrast to  that radiusclient  also uses  the radius  protocol to
authenticate the user.

this is the  development package, to be able  to develop programs that
uses the radius library.
