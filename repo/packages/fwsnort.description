Snort-to-iptables rule translator
	
fwsnort translates snort rules into equivalent iptables rules and
generates a shell script that implements the resulting iptables
commands.

this allows network traffic that matches snort signatures to be logged
and/or dropped by iptables directly without putting any interface into
promiscuous mode or queuing packets from kernel to user space.
