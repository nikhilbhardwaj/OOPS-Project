Library that simplifies the interaction with pkcs#11
	
libpkcs11-helper is a library that simplifies the interaction with pkcs#11
providers for end-user applications.

libpkcs11-helper allows using multiple pkcs#11 providers at the same time,
enumerating available token certificates, or selecting a certificate
directly by serialized id, handling card removal and card insert
events, handling card re-insert to a different slot, supporting session
expiration and much more all using a simple api.

libpkcs11-helper is not designed to manage card content, since object
attributes are usually vendor specific, and 99% of application need to
access existing objects in order to perform signature and decryption.
