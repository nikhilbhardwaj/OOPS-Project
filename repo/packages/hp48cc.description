C-like compiler which produces hp48 rpn
	
`hp48cc' is a c-like compiler that translates the input code into the
hp48 rpn language.  the language recognized by the compiler is only a small
subset of the c language, with some non-standard extensions, but powerful
enough to write complex programs simply.
