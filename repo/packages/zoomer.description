Generate a video from a picture by zooming from one point to another
	
zoomer automatically generates a video from a picture. it starts at the full
picture and then zooms into the first point. then zooms out and into the next
point, etc. at the moment of reaching a point, zoomer will write a text (e.g.
a name).

zoomer needs a picture (bigger is better) and a data file to define the points
to be zoomed into.
