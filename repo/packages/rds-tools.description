Tools for the infiniband rds protocol
	
rds-tools is a collection of support tools for the
reliable datagram socket (rds) protocol.

rds provides reliable, ordered datagram delivery by using a single
reliable connection between any two nodes in the cluster. this allows
applications to use a single socket to talk to any other process in the
cluster - so in a cluster with n processes you need n sockets, in contrast
to n*n if you use a connection-oriented socket transport like tcp.
