these are the backup scripts used by chiark.greenend.org.uk and other
systems belonging to the sinister greenend organisation.  features:

 * suitable for single systems and small networks.
 * reasonably simple; they do what you tell it to.
 * hard failures when individual systems fail, to encourage fixing !
