Object-oriented interface to select() for perl
	
io::multiplex is designed to take the effort out of managing
multiple file handles.  it is essentially a really fancy front end to
the select() system call.  in addition to maintaining the select()
loop, it buffers all input and output to/from the file handles.  it
can also accept incoming connections on one or more listen sockets.
