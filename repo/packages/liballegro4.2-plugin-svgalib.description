Svgalib video plugin for the allegro library
	
this plugin adds support for the svgalib graphics library to the allegro
library. programs using the svgalib library need to run with root permissions,
so you probably do not want to use this plugin unless you have very good
reasons to do so.

allegro is a cross-platform library intended for use in computer
games and other types of multimedia programming. it is used by many
dos games and can be used to port them easily to linux.
