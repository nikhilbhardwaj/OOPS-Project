Sfv checker and generator
	
sfv, simple file verification, uses crc32 checksums to verify
that files are intact. cksfv automates the task of generating
and checking .sfv sheets.
for integrity, md5 checksums are probably a better alternative,
but sfv is a widely used method for verification on the
usenet binary newsgroups and other places.
