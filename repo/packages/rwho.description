Clients to query the rwho server
	
the rwho command produces output similar to who, but for all machines on
the local network.  if no report has been received from a machine for 11
minutes then rwho assumes the machine is down, and does not report users
last known to be logged into that machine.

the ruptime command gives a status line like uptime for each machine on the
local network; these are formed from packets broadcast by each host on the
network once a minute.
