Graphical frontend for the par2 utility
	
par2 files create redundant data that can be used later in case parts
of the original data is lost or corrupted.

pypar2 is a graphical frontend for the par2 command line utility, it is
designed to be very easy to use. for this reason:

 * advanced settings are present, but hidden by default.
 * there is no preferences dialog, all selected options are automatically
   saved and restored.
