Controller and view framework used by rails
	
action pack splits the response to a requests into a controller part
(performing the logic) and a view part (rendering a template). this two-step
approach is known as an action, which will normally create, read, update, or
delete (crud for short) some sort of model part (often backed by a database)
before choosing either to render a template or redirecting to another action.

this is an empty dependency package.
