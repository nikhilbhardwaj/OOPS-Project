the goals of this architecture include:


 * absolutely uncompromised output quality
 * speed, memory efficiency, and other related performance goals
 * ability to work smoothly with postscript printers, fonts, and other
   resources
 * a screen display derived from the canvas
 * an extension path for a wide variety of unicode scripts
 * an extension path for a richer set of graphics operators than postscript
   supports, especially transparency
 * to make life as easy as possible for application developers
