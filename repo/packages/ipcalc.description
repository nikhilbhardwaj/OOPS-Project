Parameter calculator for ipv4 addresses
	
ipcalc takes an ip address and netmask and calculates the resulting
broadcast, network, cisco wildcard mask, and host range. by giving a
second netmask, you can design sub- and supernetworks. it is also
intended to be a teaching tool and presents the results as
easy-to-understand binary values.

originally, ipcalc was intended for use from the shell prompt, but a
cgi wrapper is provided to enable colorful html display through a
webserver.
