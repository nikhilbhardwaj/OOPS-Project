Generate html indexes of popular tags
	
html::tagcloud enables you to generate "tag clouds" html pages.
tag clouds serve as a textual way to visualize terms and topics that
are used most frequently. the tags are sorted alphabetically and a larger
font is used to indicate more frequent term usage.

example sites with tag clouds: <http://www.43things.com/>,
<http://www.astray.com/recipes/> and <http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/>.
