Gnome display manager
	
gdm provides the equivalent of a "login:" prompt for x displays- it
pops up a login window and starts an x session.

it provides all the functionality of xdm, including xdmcp support for
managing remote displays.

the greeting window is written using the gnome libraries and hence
looks like a gnome application- even to the extent of supporting
themes! by default, the greeter is run as an unprivileged user for
security.
