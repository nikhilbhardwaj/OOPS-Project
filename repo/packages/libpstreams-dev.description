A c++ iostream interface to posix process i/o
	
pstreams allows you to run another program from your c++ application and to
transfer data between the two programs, similar to shell pipelines. the
pstreams class works like a wrapper for the the posix.2 functions popen(3) and
pclose(3) (although it doesn't actually use them), using a c++ iostreams
interface, instead of c's stdio library. thus, pstreams makes it possible to
run an external program and handle its stdin, stdout, and stderr just like you
would handle any other c++ iostream.
