Irregular sampling analysis functions for octave
	
this package provides functions to do irregular sampling analysis in
octave, a numerical computation software. it contains functions to
reconstruct the frequency representation of a band-limited signal
from an irregular sampled timeseries (irsa_act), compute the
discrete fourier transformation of irregular sampled time series
(irsa_dft) and many more.

this octave add-on package is part of the octave-forge project.
