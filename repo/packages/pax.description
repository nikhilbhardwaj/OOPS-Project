Portable archive interchange
	
pax is an archiving utility that reads and writes tar and cpio formats,
both the traditional ones and the extended formats specified in ieee 1003.1.
it handles multi-volume archives and automatically determines the format
of an archive while reading it.  the pax interface was designed by ieee
1003.2 as a compromise in the chronic controversy over which of tar or
cpio is best.

this is the free openbsd's version written by keith muller.
