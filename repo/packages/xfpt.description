Generate xml from plain text
	
xfpt is a program that reads a file of plain text that contains relatively
simple markup, and outputs an xml file. it is intended to simplify the
management of xml data. it is not a program that attempts to turn a plain text
document into xml. markup within text is introduced by ampersand characters,
but is otherwise "soft". you can define what follows the ampersand, for
example, &" to generate a "quote" element. there is also a macro facility that
allows for higher level concepts such as chapters, displays, tables, etc.
