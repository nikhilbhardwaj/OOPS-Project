Opengl context support for gtk+ (development files)
	
the gtkgl library provides gtkglarea (a gtk+ widget containing an opengl
context for fast 2d and 3d graphics), gdkglpixmap (an off-screen rendering
context) and gdkglcontext (an opengl extension for virtually any drawable
widget).

this package contains the headers and static library.
