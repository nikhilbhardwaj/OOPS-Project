Foundation of a poe http daemon
	
poe::component::server::http is a framework for building custom http servers
based on poe. it is loosely modeled on the ideas of apache and the
mod_perl/apache module.

it is built a lot on work done by gisle aas on http::* modules and the
uri module which are subclassed.

it lets you register different handlers, stacked by directory that will be run
during the cause of the request.
