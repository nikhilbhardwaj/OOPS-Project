Module for performing numeric comparisons in perl
	
number::compare allows to compile a simple comparison to an anonymous
subroutine, which can then be called with a value to be tested against.

the advantage of using this module is that it understands both the si prefixes
'k', 'm', and 'g', as well as the iec binary prefixes 'ki', 'mi' and 'gi'.
