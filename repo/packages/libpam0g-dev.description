Development files for pam
	
contains c header files and development shared libraries for libpam, the
pluggable authentication modules, a suite of shared libraries that enable
the local system administrator to choose how applications authenticate
users.

pam decouples applications from the authentication mechanism, making it
possible to upgrade the authentication system without recompiling or
rewriting the applications.
