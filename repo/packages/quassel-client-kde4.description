Distributed irc client - kde-based client
	
quassel is a modern, cross-platform, distributed irc client, meaning that
one or more clients can attach to and detach from the central core. it's
much like the popular combination of screen and a text-based irc client
such as weechat or irssi, but graphical.

this package provides only the client component compiled with kde4 support.
