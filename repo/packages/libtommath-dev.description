Multiple-precision integer library [development files]
	
libtommath is a c language library that provides a vast array of highly
optimized functions for number theory; including:


 * simple algebra (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
 * digit manipulation (shift, binary and/or/xor)
 * modular reduction (barrett, montgomery, dr, 2k)
 * number theory
   - greatest common divisor
   - least common multiple
   - jacobi symbol computation
   - multiplicative inverse
   - modular exponentiation
   - fermat & miller-rabin primality tests
 * miscellaneous
   - root finding over z
   - pseudo-random integers
   - signed & unsigned comparisons
   - karatsuba and toom-cook multiplication algorithms
   - fast comba based multiplier, squaring and montgomery routines


this package contains the files needed to create programs that use libtommath.
it is not needed to merely execute programs that use libtommath.
