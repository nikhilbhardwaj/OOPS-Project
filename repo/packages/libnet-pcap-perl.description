Perl binding to the lbl pcap packet capture library
	
net::pcap module allows the user to interface with the lbl pcap(3) library.
libpcap describes itself as "a system-independent interface for user-level
packet capture. libpcap provides a portable framework for low-level network
monitoring." this modules gives a program the ability to capture data from a
network interface in a similar way tcpdump does.
