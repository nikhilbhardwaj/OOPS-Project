Cd-r(w) backup utility
	
cdbackup and cdrestore are a pair of utilities designed to facilitate
streaming backup to and from cd-r(w) disks.  specifically, they were
designed to work with dump/restore, but tar/cpio/whatever you want should
work, so long as it writes to stdout for backups and reads from stdin for
restores.
