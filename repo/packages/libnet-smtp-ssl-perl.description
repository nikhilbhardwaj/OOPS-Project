Ssl support for net::smtp
	
implements the same api as net::smtp, but uses io::socket::ssl for its
network operations. due to the nature of net::smtp's new method, it is not
overridden to make use of a default port for the smtps service. perhaps
future versions will be smart like that. port 465 is usually what you want,
and it's not a pain to specify that.
