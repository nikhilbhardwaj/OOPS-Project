Persistent key-value database with network interface
	
redis is a key-value database in a similar vein to memcache but the dataset
is non-volatile. redis additionally provides native support for atomically
manipulating and querying data structures such as lists and sets.

the dataset is stored entirely in memory and periodically flushed to disk.
