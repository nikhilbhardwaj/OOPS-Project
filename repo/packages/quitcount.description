A small tool which may help yourself quit smoking
	
quitcount is a simple counter that shows what you spared since
you quit smoking. once you tell it the date you quit, how much
you smoked, and how much it cost, it'll tell you how many
cigarettes you didn't smoke since, and how much it makes in
terms of money, tar, and life expectancy.
