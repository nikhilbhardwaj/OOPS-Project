Test module to validate a cpan meta.yml file
	
the test::cpan::meta module was written to ensure that a meta.yml file,
provided with a standard distribution uploaded to cpan, meets the
specifications that are slowly being introduced to module uploads, via the use
of package makers and installers such as extutils::makemaker, module::build
and module::install.
