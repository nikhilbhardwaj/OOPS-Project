Non-negative numbers for haskell; profiling libraries
	
this package provides a library for the haskell programming language
compiled for profiling.
see http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on haskell.

this library provides a class for non-negative numbers, a wrapper which
can turn any ordered numeric type into a member of that class, and a
lazy number type for non-negative numbers (a generalization of peano
numbers).
