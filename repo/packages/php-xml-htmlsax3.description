Sax parser for html and other badly formed xml documents
	
php-xml-htmlsax3 provides an api very similar to the native
php xml extension (http://www.php.net/xml), allowing handlers
using one to be easily adapted to the other.

the key difference is php-xml-htmlsax3 will not break
on badly formed xml, allowing it to be used for parsing
html documents.
