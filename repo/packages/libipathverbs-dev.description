Development files for the libipathverbs driver
	
libipathverbs is a device-specific driver for qlogic infiniband host
channel adapters (hcas) for the libibverbs library.  this allows
userspace processes to access qlogic hca hardware directly with
low latency and low overhead.

this package contains static versions of libipathverbs that may be linked
directly to an application, which may be useful for debugging.
