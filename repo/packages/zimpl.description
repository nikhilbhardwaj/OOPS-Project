Mathematical modeling language for optimization problems
	
zimpl allows the specification of certain optimization problems - linear
programs (lps) and mixed integer programs (mips) - in a high-level
description language. these descriptions can be converted into the
lp or mps file formats which are understood by lp and mip solvers.
