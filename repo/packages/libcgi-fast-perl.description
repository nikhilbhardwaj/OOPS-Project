Cgi::fast perl module
	
cgi::fast is a subclass of the cgi object created by cgi.pm.  it is
specialized to work well with the open market fastcgi standard, which
greatly speeds up cgi scripts by turning them into persistently running
server processes.  scripts that perform time-consuming initialization
processes, such as loading large modules or opening persistent database
connections, will see large performance improvements.
