Python extension to speed up fonttools
	
this is an optional c implementation of part of fonttools that speeds
up the eexec and charstring encryption algorithms as used by postscript
type 1 fonts. fonttools is much faster with it, it is quite small but
most people will be using fonttools with truetype or opentype fonts
so fonttools recommends it instead of depending on it.
