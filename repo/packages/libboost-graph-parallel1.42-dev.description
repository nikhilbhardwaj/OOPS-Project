Generic graph components and algorithms in c++
	
this package forms part of the boost c++ libraries collection.

the parallel boost graph library is an extension to the boost graph library
(bgl) for parallel and distributed computing. it offers distributed graphs
and graph algorithms to exploit coarse-grained parallelism along with
parallel algorithms that exploit fine-grained parallelism, while retaining
the same interfaces as the (sequential) bgl. code written using the sequential
bgl should be easy to parallelize with the parallel bgl.
