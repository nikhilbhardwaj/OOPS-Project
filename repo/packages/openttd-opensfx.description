A sound set for use with the openttd game
	
opensfx is a replacement for the original ttd (transport tycoon deluxe) base
sounds used by openttd, distributed under a restrictive license. the main goal
of opensfx therefore is to provide a set of free sounds which make it possible
to play openttd without requiring the (copyrighted) files from original
transport tycoon deluxe game.
