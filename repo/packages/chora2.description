Code repository viewing component for horde framework
	
chora allows the viewing of local (to the server) rcs and cvs repositories
as well as local and remote subversion repositories.  it is written
completely in php and is a component of the horde project.

currently, chora has feature parity with cvs-web and also includes a new
feature, called visual branch viewing, that aims to make the concept of
branches and branch histories less confusing.
