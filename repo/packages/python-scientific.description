Python modules useful for scientific computing
	
scientificpython is a collection of python modules that are
useful for scientific computing. most modules are rather general,
others belong to specific domains and will be of interest to only a
small number of users (e.g. the module scientific.io.pdb). almost all
modules make extensive use of numerical python (numpy)
