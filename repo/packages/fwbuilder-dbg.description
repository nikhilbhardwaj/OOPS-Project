Firewall administration tool gui (debugging symbols)
	
firewall builder consists of an object-oriented gui and a set of policy
compilers for various firewall platforms. in firewall builder, firewall
policy is a set of rules, each rule consists of abstract objects which
represent real network objects and services (hosts, routers, firewalls,
networks, protocols). firewall builder helps the user maintain a database
of objects and allows policy editing using simple drag-and-drop operations.
