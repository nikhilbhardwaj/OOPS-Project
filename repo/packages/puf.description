Parallel url fetcher
	
puf is a download tool for unix-like systems. you may use it to download
single files or to mirror entire servers. it is similar to gnu wget
(and has a partly compatible command line), but has the ability to do
many downloads in parallel. this is very interesting, if you have a
high-bandwidth internet connection.
