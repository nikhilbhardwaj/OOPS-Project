Adaptive readahead daemon
	
preload monitors applications that users run, and by analyzing this
data, predicts what applications users might run, and fetches those
binaries and their dependencies into memory for faster startup times.

note that installing preload will not make your system boot faster
and that preload is a daemon that runs with root priviledges.
