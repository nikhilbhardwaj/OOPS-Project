Modular assembler with multiple syntaxes support
	
yasm is a complete rewrite of the nasm assembler. it supports multiple
assembler syntaxes (eg, nasm, gas, tasm, etc.) in addition to multiple
output object formats (binary objects, coff, win32, elf32, elf64) and
even multiple instruction sets (including amd64). it also has an
optimiser module.
