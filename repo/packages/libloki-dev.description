A c++ library of generic design patterns (development files)
	
loki is a ("the"?) c++ library of generic programming techniques, containing
flexible implementations of common design patterns and idioms. it is an
essential library for modern c++ programming and exposes many cool features
of the language.

the code accompanies the (non-free) book, _modern c++ design_ (alexandrescu,
2001), which goes into depth on the design of the library.

this package contains the header files and static libraries needed
to build programs that use loki.
