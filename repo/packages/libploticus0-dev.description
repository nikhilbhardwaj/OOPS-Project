Development files for the ploticus library
	
libploticus is not a function or mathematical plotting package like
gnuplot, nor would it be a good choice for applications where
mathematical formulas or scientific notations are to be rendered
as an integral part of the data display.  libploticus is also not
intended as a "marketing" graphics package.  its goal is to
display data crisply without extra decoration and distracting
"dingbats" that cloud the picture.
