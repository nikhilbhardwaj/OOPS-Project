tools for running quickcheck properties as hunit test cases, allowing you to
combine both approaches in a single program.  it also includes tools for more
helpful displays of running progress in both hunit and quickcheck, additional
generators for other types for quickcheck, and shortcuts for quickly defining
new test cases.
