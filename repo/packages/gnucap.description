Gnu circuit analysis package
	
gnucap is a general purpose circuit simulator.  it performs nonlinear
dc and transient analyses, fourier analysis, and ac analysis
linearized at an operating point.  it is fully interactive and
command driven.  it can also be run in batch mode or as a server.
the output is produced as it simulates.  spice compatible models
for the mosfet (level 1,2,3) and diode are included in this
release.
