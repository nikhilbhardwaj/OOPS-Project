A basic tool-kit for sparse matrix computations - devel
	
sparskit a basic tool-kit for sparse matrix computations. sparskit is a general
purpose fortran-77  library for sparse matrix computations. it has been
gathered over several years and includes some of the most useful tools for
developing and implementing sparse matrix techniques, particularly for
iterative solvers. if you need a simple routine for doing a sparse matrix
operation (e.g., adding two sparse matrices, or reordering a sparse matrix) it
is likely to be available in sparskit. sparskit also contains most of the
iterative accelarators and a number of efficient preconditioners.
