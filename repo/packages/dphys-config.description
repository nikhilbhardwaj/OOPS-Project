Tool to distribute config files
	
this project is aimed at automatically installing (and keeping
update) site specific config files on many hosts, after preprocessing
them (conditional content and include files and include sections). it
also triggers postinstall scripts whenever their associated config
file has been changed. it can also remove config files, including
running an preremove script before doing so. all this is driven by an
simple config file list.
