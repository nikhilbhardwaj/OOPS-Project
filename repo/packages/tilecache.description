A web map tile caching system
	
tilecache is an implementation of a wms-c compliant server made available by
metacarta. tilecache provides a python-based wms/tms server, with pluggable
caching mechanisms and rendering backends. in the simplest use case, tilecache
requires only write access to a disk, the ability to run python cgi scripts,
and a wms you want to be cached. with these resources, you can create your own
local disk-based cache of any wms server, and use the result in any wms-c
supporting client, like openlayers, or any tms supporting client, like
openlayers and worldkit.
