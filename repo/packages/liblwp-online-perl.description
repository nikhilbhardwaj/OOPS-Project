Module to check if there is internet access
	
lwp::online will try to verify, as accurately as it can, if the
host has any internet access: it will check if there is basic
network access, dns connectivity and it will also check whether
one from a whole set of transport (http, https, ftp, and so on) is
actually available

the exported 'online' function can also be used by other modules to
skip the tests which require internet connectivity.
