Hierarchical, prioritised todo list manager
	
manipulate and display a hierarchical (ie "subtasks") and prioritised
list of things with a coloured command line interface.

using devtodos output formatting features, it is possible to convert
the todo list into almost any text format.

devtodo comes with xslt stylesheets to convert xml .todo files to html
and pdf, have a look at /usr/share/devtodo/.
