Utility to make certain embedded devices bootable
	
flash-kernel is a script which will put the kernel and initramfs in
the boot location of embedded devices that don't load the kernel and
initramfs directly from /boot.  flash-kernel supports devices that
boot from flash memory (hence the name) as well as some devices that
require a special boot image on the disk.
