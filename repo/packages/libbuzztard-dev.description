Modular music composer - development files
	
the buzztard project aims to provide a modular, free, open source music
studio that is conceptually based on the proprietary windows software
called buzz. the buzztard project itself has no direct link to buzz
apart from its concepts that we build upon and is no 1:1 buzz copy.
to allow migration for buzz users, buzztard provides song-file import
and buzz-machine reuse.

this package contains the header files that are needed to
link to the shared library.
