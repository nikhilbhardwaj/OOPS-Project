Plugin library for merb that provides helpers for assets
	
provides extra functionality related to assets:

 * assets bundling.
 * assets hosts.
 * helpers to add asset links to views.
 * deployment-time assets processing (for instance, with yui compressor).


this package is a dependency package, which depends on the package
containing actual ruby merb-assets libraries for the default ruby version
(currently 1.8).
