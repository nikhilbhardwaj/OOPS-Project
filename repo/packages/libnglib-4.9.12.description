Automatic 3d tetrahedral mesh generator development files
	
netgen is an automatic 3d tetrahedral mesh generator. it accepts
input from constructive solid geometry (csg) or boundary
representation (brep) from stl file format. the connection to a
geometry kernel allows the handling of iges and step files. netgen
contains modules for mesh optimization and hierarchical mesh
refinement.

this package contains the shared libraries.
