C library for developing cgi applications
	
cgic is an ansi-c library for the creation of cgi-based world wide web
applications.  cgic provides the following:


  * parses form data, correcting for defective and/or inconsistent
    browsers
  * transparently accepts both get and post form data
  * handles line breaks in form fields in a consistent manner
  * provides string, integer, floating-point, and single- and
    multiple-choice functions to retrieve form data
  * provides bounds checking for numeric fields
  * loads cgi environment variables into c strings which are always
    non-null
  * provides a way to capture cgi situations for replay in a debugging
    environment


this package provides a static library version of cgic, examples of using
cgic (including a cgi application that captures a cgi environment for use
in debugging), and header files.
