Upload progress support for the apache web server
	
mod_upload_progress allows to monitor status of http file uploads.

website authors can then query the server using javascript to provide better
feedback (e.g. progress bar, throughput) while the browser is uploading.

this module produces output similar to the equivalent modules for nginx and
lighttpd.
