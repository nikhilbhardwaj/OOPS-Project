Module to provide mapping between uris and on-disk storage
	
uri::todisk is a perl module which provides an object that can easily map
between uniform resource identifiers (uris) and on-disk storage. in several
processes relating to working with the web, one may need to keep track of an
area on disk which maps to a particular uri.

using this information, the module can derive both a filesystem path and uri
for any file or directory in this location that one might need to work with.
