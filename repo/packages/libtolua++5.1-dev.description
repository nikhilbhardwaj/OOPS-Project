Extended tool to integrate c/c++ code with lua
	
tolua++5.1 is an extension of tolua, a tool to integrate c/c++ code with
lua. tolua++5.1 includes new features oriented to c++, such as class
templates and is compiled with the newest lua 5.1.

based on a "cleaned" header file, tolua++ automatically generates
the binding code to access c/c++ features from lua. using lua-5.1 api and
metamethod facilities, the current version automatically maps c/c++
constants, external variables, functions, namespace, classes, and methods
to lua. it also provides facilities to create lua modules.
