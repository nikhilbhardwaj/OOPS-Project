Japanese character screensaver
	
kannasaver is a screensaver that displays random characters from the
japanese syllabary, ideally causing them to stick in your memory after
you've viewed them a number of times. kannasaver can be configured to
display basic, extended, and compound characters from hiragana, katakana,
or both simultaneously.

you should install a font with japanese character support before using
kannasaver.
