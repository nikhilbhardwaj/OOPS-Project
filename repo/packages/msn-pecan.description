Alternative msn protocol plug-in for libpurple
	
msn-pecan is an alternative and improved implementation of the msn protocol
plug-in for libpurple.

it's based on the code from 2.2.2 but slowly becoming a completely different
code. the project aims to have a much faster development process, low barrier
for contributions, and close contact with the user-base.
