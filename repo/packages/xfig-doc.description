Xfig on-line documentation and examples
	
xfig is a menu-driven tool that allows the user to draw and manipulate objects
interactively in an x window.  the resulting pictures can be saved, printed
on postscript printers, or converted to a variety of other formats (e.g.  to
allow inclusion in latex documents or web pages) using the transfig program.

this package contains on-line documentation in html and pdf formats as well as
the graphics examples distributed with xfig.
