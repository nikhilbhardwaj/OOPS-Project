The connection-set algebra implemented in python
	
the csa library provides elementary connection-sets and operators for
combining them. it also provides an iteration interface to such
connection-sets enabling efficient iteration over existing connections
with a small memory footprint also for very large networks. the csa
can be used as a component of neuronal network simulators or other
tools.
