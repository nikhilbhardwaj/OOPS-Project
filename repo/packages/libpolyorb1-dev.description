Multiple-personality middleware for ada (development)
	
polyorb provides a uniform solution to build distributed applications; relying
either on industrial-strength middleware standards such as corba, the
distributed system annex of ada 95, distribution programming paradigms such as
web services, message oriented middleware (mom), or to implement
application-specific middleware.

this package provides the development files and utilities necessary to develop
distributed applications using polyorb.

distributed applications will also require the polyorb-servers package but not
necessarily on the same machine.
