Time-series data storage and display system (programs)
	
the round robin database tool (rrdtool) is a system to store and display
time-series data (e.g. network bandwidth, machine-room temperature,
server load average). it stores the data in round robin databases (rrds),
a very compact way that will not expand over time. rrdtool processes the
extracted data to enforce a certain data density, allowing for useful
graphical representation of data values.

rrdtool is often used via various wrappers that can poll data from devices
and feed data into rrds, as well as provide a friendlier user interface and
customized graphs.

this package contains command-line programs used to access and manipulate
rrds.
