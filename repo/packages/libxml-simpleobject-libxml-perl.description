Simple oo representation of an xml::libxml dom object
	
xml::simpleobject is a short and simple class allowing simple object
access to a parsed xml::parser tree, with methods for fetching children
and attributes in as clean a manner as possible.

this is a small and quick module, with easy and compact usage. some
will rightfully question placing another interface over the dom methods
provided by xml::libxml, but others appreciate the total simplicity
provided by this module, despite its limitations.
