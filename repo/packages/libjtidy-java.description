A java port of html tidy, a html syntax checker and pretty printer
	
jtidy is a java port of html tidy (http://www.w3.org/people/raggett/tidy/).
like its non-java cousin, jtidy can be used as a tool for cleaning up malformed
and faulty html. in addition, jtidy provides a dom interface to the document
that is being processed, which effectively makes you able to use jtidy as a
dom parser for real-world html.
