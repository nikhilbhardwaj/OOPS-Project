Module for calculating smooth numerical transitions
	
math::gradient is a perl module that is useful for calculating numbers needed
to make smooth transitions between two or more numerical values (graphically
represented as gradients). the primary intent of this module is to make it
easy to mix colours, both in terms of basic and multiple-point gradients.
