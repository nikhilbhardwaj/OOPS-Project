Kernel patch allowing to use partly-bad ram modules
	
this package contains a patch to the linux kernel, which allows to tell
the kernel which parts of a ram module are bad.  this allows you to
use old ram modules, when for example just 1 bit in your 256mb module
makes it otherwise unusable.

packages memtest86 and memtest86+ allow to test the ram for such
problems, and are able to tell you what parameters to give to a
badram-enabled kernel.
