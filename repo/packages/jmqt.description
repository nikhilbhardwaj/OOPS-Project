Qt version of jugglemaster
	
jugglemaster is a siteswap animator. a siteswap is a textual representation
for patterns one can juggle (using balls, clubs, etc.). it is mainly useful
for understanding specific siteswaps by animating them (including
multiplexing). other uses may include watching patterns without understanding
the notation behind them.

this package contains the qt interface. it doesn't come with patterns.
