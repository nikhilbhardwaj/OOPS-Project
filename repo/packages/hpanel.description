Minimalist panel for x
	
hpanel is hacked version of fspanel, a small panel that lists your
windows and allows you to switch workspaces. it requires a window
manager that is compliant with the netwm specification. it works
nicely with pekwm and aewm++, and handles maximized windows better
than fspanel.
