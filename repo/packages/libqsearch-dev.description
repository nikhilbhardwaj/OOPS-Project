Nondeterministic quartet tree search library for unrooted trees
	
qsearch is a library for universal hierarchical clustering using an arbitrary
distance matrix as input.  it searches through the space of all possible
unrooted trees of a given size and finds the closest match based on a
weighted quartet cost function determined by the distance matrix.  when
used in combination with other feature extraction libraries such as
libcomplearn this system can be used for fast and accurate phylogenetic
reconstruction, linguistic analysis, or stemmatology.
