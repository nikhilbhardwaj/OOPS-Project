Perl module that creates temporary files for testing
	
test::tempdir provides temporary directory creation with testing in mind.

the differences between this module and file::temp are:

 * prevent race conditions when running parallel tests harness
 * empty directory before running tests
 * files are not cleaned at the end of the tests if they fail
