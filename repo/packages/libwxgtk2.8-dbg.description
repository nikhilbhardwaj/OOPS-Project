Wxwidgets cross-platform c++ gui toolkit (gtk+ debug)
	
wxwidgets (formerly known as wxwindows) is a class library for c++ providing
gui components and other facilities on several popular platforms (and some
unpopular ones as well).

this package provides a debug version of the wxgtk library.  it is compiled
both with -g for normal debugger tracing and with the __wxdebug__ flag which
provides many internal checks by wxwidgets itself that are not performed on
apps compiled with the 'release version' libs in the -dev package.
