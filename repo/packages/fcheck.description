Ids filesystem baseline integrity checker
	
the fcheck utility is an ids (intrusion detection system)
which can be used to monitor changes to any given filesystem.

essentially, fcheck has the ability to monitor directories, files
or complete filesystems for any additions, deletions, and modifications.
it is configurable to exclude active log files, and can be run as often
as needed from the command line or cron making it extremely difficult to
circumvent.
