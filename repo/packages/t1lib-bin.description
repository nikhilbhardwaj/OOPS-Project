Type 1 font rasterizer library - user binaries
	
t1lib is an enhanced rasterizer for type 1 fonts.

t1lib is based on the x11r5 font rasterizer code, but operates independently
of x11.  it includes many enhancements, including underlining, antialiasing,
user-defined slant and extension factors, and rotation.

this package contains the programs "xglyph" and "type1afm", included in the
upstream t1lib distribution.  it also contains the "t1libconfig"
script used to configure t1lib.
