Solve differential equations and initial value problems in octave
	
this package provides a toolkit for differential equations and
initial value problems for octave, a numerical computation software.
it implements the runge-kutta, hairer-wanner and cash bdf solvers of
systems of differential equations.

this octave add-on package is part of the octave-forge project.
