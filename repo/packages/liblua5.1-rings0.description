Lua state creation and control library for the lua language version 5.1
	
rings is a library which provides a way to create new lua states from within
lua. it also offers a simple way to communicate between the creator (master)
and the created (slave) states.

this mechanism can be used to run chunks of code in an isolated
lua state, obtaining what is usually called a sandbox.
