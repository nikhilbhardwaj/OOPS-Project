class::dbi::pager is a plugin for class::dbi, which glues data::page
with class::dbi. this module reduces your work a lot, for example
when you have to do something like:


 * retrieve objects from a database
 * display objects with 20 items per page


in addition, your work will be reduced more, when you use
template-toolkit as your templating engine.
