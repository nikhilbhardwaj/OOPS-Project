Extensible open router platform
	
xorp is the extensible open router platform. it implements a number of
routing protocols for ipv4 and ipv6 and a unified means to configure them. it
is stable and fully featured enough for production use, and flexible and
extensible enough to enable network research.

the following network protocols are currently
supported: bgp, ospf, rip/ripng, igmp/mld and pim-sm.
