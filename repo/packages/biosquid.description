Utilities for biological sequence analysis
	
squid is a library of c code functions for sequence analysis. it also
includes a number of small utility programs to convert, show statistics,
manipulate and do other functions on sequence files.

the original name of the package is "squid", but since there is already
a squid on the archive (a proxy cache), it was renamed to "biosquid".
