Freesmartphone.org dbus xml specification & documentation
	
the desktop-bus prepares applications to communicate with another
by the sending of predefined signals. the process is agnostic about
programming languages, but the collaborating tools need to agree on a
common set of signals and their interpretation.  this package provides
the dbus specifications of the freesmartphone.org software stack that is
targeted for smartphones.  process these with a dbus binding generator
to create stubs for your program.
