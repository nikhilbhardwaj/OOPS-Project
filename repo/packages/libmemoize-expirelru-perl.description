Expiry plug-in for memoize that adds lru cache expiration
	
memoize::expirelru implements an expiry policy for memoize that follows lru
semantics, that is, the last n results, where n is specified as the argument
to the cachesize parameter, will be cached.

for the theory of memoization, please see the memoize module documentation.
