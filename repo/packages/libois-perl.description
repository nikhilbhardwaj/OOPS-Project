Perl binding for the ois c++ input framework
	
this is a perl binding for ois, object-oriented input system, a crossplatform
c++ input framework, found at <http://sourceforge.net/projects/wgois>. it is
made so that ogre (<http://search.cpan.org/~slanning/ogre/>) can be useful,
but there might be uses outside of ogre.

the wrapping isn't really complete at the moment.
