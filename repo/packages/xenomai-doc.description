Xenomai documentation
	
xenomai is a real-time development framework cooperating with the linux
kernel in order to provide a pervasive, interface-agnostic, hard real-time
support to user-space applications, seamlessly integrated into the gnu/linux
environment. xenomai provides its own api and emulation layers ("skins") to
make migration from other rtos easier. examples are: psos+, vxworks, vrtx,
uitron, rtai, posix.
