Crazy eddie's gui (development files)
	
cegui is a free library providing windowing and widgets for graphics
apis and engines where such functionality is not natively available
or is severely lacking. the library is written in c++, is object
oriented, and is primarily targeted at games developers who should be
spending their time creating great games, not building gui sub-systems

this version of cegui natively supports the opengl rendering target
and contains the development files for cegui.
