Tool to synchronize ldap servers using ldif formatted input files
	
ldapdiff compares ldif files with a running ldap server and does an
appropriate add/delete/update for every changed entry/attribute.

essentially, it combines "diff" and "patch" in one application (although it is
designed for "patching" ldap directories using ldif files, not for use on flat
ascii files).
