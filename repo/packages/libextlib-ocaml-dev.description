Extended standard library for ocaml
	
extlib is a project aiming at providing a complete - yet small -
standard library for the ocaml programming language.

the purpose of this library is to add new functions to ocaml
standard library modules, to modify some functions in order to
get better performances or more safety (tail-recursive) but also
to provide new modules which should be useful for the average
ocaml programmer.

extlib contains modules implementing: enumeration over abstract
collection of elements, efficient bit sets, dynamic arrays,
references on lists, unicode characters and utf-8 encoded
strings, additional and improved functions for hashtables,
strings, lists and option types.
