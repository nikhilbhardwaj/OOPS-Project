Squirrelmail plugin: disallow access to users/domains
	
this plugin allows you to create a list of users and/or domains that should be
disallowed login access to squirrelmail. it also allows you to block
brute-force password guessing attacks, although please note that this will
only help fight such attacks in the squirrelmail interface, and should really
be implemented in your mail system's authentication backend.

squirrelmail is a standards-based webmail package written in php. it runs on
top of any imap server.
