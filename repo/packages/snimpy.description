Interactive snmp tool with python
	
snimpy is a python-based tool providing a simple interface to build
snmp queries. this interface aims at being the most pythonic
possible: you grab scalars using attributes and columns are like
dictionaries.

snimpy can either be used interactively through its console (derived
from python own console or from ipython if available) or by writing
snimpy scripts which are just python scripts with some global
variables available.
