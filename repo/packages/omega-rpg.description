A text-based roguelike game
	
omega is a complex rogue-style game of dungeon exploration. unlike other such
games, there are a number of ways to "win", depending on various actions
taken during play. the ways you can get your name on the high score board
include becoming the highest ranked head of a guild, sect, college, etc., as
well as gaining the most points figured from possessions and experience. the
game (via the oracle) may impose some structure on your exploration, but you
need not follow all of the oracle's advice. there *is* a "total winner"
status, by the way.
