Development files for the qt cryptographic architecture
	
the qt cryptographic architecture (qca) provides a straightforward and cross-
platform api for a range of cryptographic features, including ssl/tls,
x.509 certificates, sasl, openpgp, s/mime cms, and smart cards.

this package contains debugging files used to investigate problems with
the qt cryptographic architecture libraries.
