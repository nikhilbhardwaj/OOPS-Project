Automatically tuned linear algebra software, test programs
	
atlas is an approach for the automatic generation and optimization of
numerical software. currently atlas supplies optimized versions for the
complete set of linear algebra kernels known as the basic linear algebra
subroutines (blas), and a subset of the linear algebra routines in the
lapack library.

this package provides dynamically linked testing and bench-marking
binaries to compare the blas and atlas libraries on your system.
