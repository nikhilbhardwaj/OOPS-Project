Openoffice.org bindings for mono cli
	
openoffice.org is a full-featured office productivity suite that provides
a near drop-in replacement for microsoft(r) office.

this package contains the cli bindings to openoffice.org for
accessing the openoffice.org api from mono languages (e.g. c# and boo)

note that currently the use of mono for add-ins & scripting inside
openoffice.org is *not* yet supported.
