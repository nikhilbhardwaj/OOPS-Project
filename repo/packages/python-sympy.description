Computer algebra system (cas) in python
	
sympy is a python library for symbolic mathematics (manipulation). it aims to
become a full-featured computer algebra system (cas) while keeping the code as
simple as possible in order to be comprehensible and easily extensible. sympy
is written entirely in python and does not require any external libraries,
except optionally for plotting support.
