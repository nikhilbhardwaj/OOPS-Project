Base32 encoder/decoder
	
similar to base64, base32 encodes arbitrary (binary) data in ascii text.  the
difference to base64 is that base32 encoding is case insensitive.

base32 is defined in rfc3548 using the characters [a-z2-7], but this module
by default uses [0-9a-v] for compatibility with older versions of
mime::base32.  an rfc compliant mode is also provided, though.
