Squirrelmail plugin: let other plugins work with older/newer sm versions
	
this plugin allows any other plugin access to the functions and special
variables needed to make it backward (and forward) compatible with most
versions of sm in wide use. this eliminates the need for duplication of
certain functions throughout many plugins. it also provides functionality that
helps check that plugins have been installed and set up correctly.

squirrelmail is a standards-based webmail package written in php. it runs on
top of any imap server.
