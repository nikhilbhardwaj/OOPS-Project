Perl module implementing advanced operations on path variables
	
env::path presents an object-oriented interface to path variables, defined
as that subclass of environment variables which name an ordered list of
filesystem elements separated by a platform-standard separator.

env::path is for cases where you need to insert or remove interior path
entries, strip redundancies, operate on a path variable without having to
know whether the current platform uses ":" or ";", operate on a path variable
which may have a different name on different platforms, etc.
