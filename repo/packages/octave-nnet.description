Feed forward multi-layer neural network functions for octave
	
this package provides functions to work with feed forwarded multi-layer
neural networks in octave, a numerical computation software. included
are functions that train the neural networks (train), simulate
neural networks (sim) and many more.

this octave add-on package is part of the octave-forge project.
