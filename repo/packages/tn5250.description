5250 telnet emulator for accessing an ibm iseries (as/400)
	
tn5250 connects to an ibm iseries (as/400) running i5/os and
emulates a 5250-compatible "green screen" terminal, or a printer
using scs or host print transform.  it runs on the linux console, in
an xterm, or on any other character terminal.

to run in a window, the xt5250 script works best with xterm, but can
use any other program providing the x-terminal-emulator interface.
