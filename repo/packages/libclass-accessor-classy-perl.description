Perl module providing minimalist, fast accessors
	
class::accessor::classy provides an extremely small-footprint accessor/mutator
declaration scheme for fast and convenient object attribute setup. its intent
is to be a simple and speedy mechanism for preventing hash-key typos rather
than a full-blown object system with type checking and so on.

the accessor ('foo') and mutator ('set_foo') methods appear as a hidden parent
class of your package and stay out of your way otherwise.
