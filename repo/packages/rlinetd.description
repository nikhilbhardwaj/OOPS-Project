Gruesomely over-featured inetd replacement
	
rlinetd is designed to replace the bsd inetd. feature-wise, it is a
proper superset of the bsd inetd, including rpc support and both udp
and tcp services. in addition, it supports a number of resource
limiting features, including full resource limits a la setrlimit(2),
renicing, chroot and limited per-service instances. to round out the
features stolen from xinetd, it also supports binding to individual
interfaces on request, and configurable logging.
