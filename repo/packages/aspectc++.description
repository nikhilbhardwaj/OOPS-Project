Aspect-oriented programming extension for c++
	
aspectc++ supports aspect-oriented programming with c++, by providing:


 - an aspect language extension to c++.
 - an aspect weaver that does source-to-source translation.


aspectc++ provides for c++ similar features like its best known
cousin, aspectj, provides for java.
