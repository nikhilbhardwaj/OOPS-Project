Perl module for dumping perl objects to html
	
data::format::html is a perl module that takes a data structure as input and
produces html suitable for output. it has support for most common perl data
types, even working with complicated nested data structures. in theory, you
can pass in any sort of data type and get a "pretty" html representation of
it. css rules can also extend this, but that behaviour is not yet documented.
