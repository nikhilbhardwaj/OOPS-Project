Converts text to postscript, html or rtf with syntax highlighting
	
gnu enscript takes ascii files (often source code) and converts them
to postscript, html or rtf.  it can store generated output to a file
or send it directly to the printer.

it is often used for its syntax highlighting, as it comes with rules
for a wide range of programming languages.  new rules can be added
using an awk-like stateful scripting language.
