Gobject based collection library (development files)
	
libgee is a collection library providing gobject-based interfaces and
classes for commonly used data structures.

libgee provides the following interfaces:

 * iterable
  * collection
   * list
   * set
 * iterator
 * map


the arraylist, hashset, and hashmap classes provide a reasonable sample
implementation of the list, set, and map interfaces. readonlycollection,
readonlylist, readonlyset, and readonlymap are read-only wrapper classes
that prevent modification of the underlying collection.

libgee is written in vala and can be used like any gobject-based c library.
it's planned to provide bindings for further languages.

this package contains the headers and development libraries.
