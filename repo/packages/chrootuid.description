Run commands in restricted environments
	
chrootuid makes it easy to run a network service at low privilege
level and with restricted file system access.  the daemons have access only
to their own directory tree, and run under a low-privileged userid.

in the past it has been used to run the gopher and www
(world-wide web) network. it can be used nowadays also for proxy servers.
the arrangement greatly reduces the impact of possible loopholes in
network software.
