Generic syntax highlighter
	
geshi aims  to be a simple but powerful highlighting class,
with the following goals:


   * support for a wide range of popular languages
   * easy to add a new language for highlighting
   * highly customisable output formats


geshi aims to  do this all as quickly  as possible. many customisable
features of geshi facilitate speed increases, and you can easily find
a balance  between the amount of  highlighting done and  the speed in
which it is done.
