Daemon for lnp communication with brickos
	
the lnpd package provides a daemon capable of being started at boot time
that enables communication with a lego(r) mindstorms rcx which is running
brickos. this package also provides a library so that you can build
client programs which talk via lnp to applications running under brickos
on the rcx.  see the examples provided.
