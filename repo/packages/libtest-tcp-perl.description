Module to test tcp/ip programs
	
test::tcp is a perl test framework for tcp/ip programs, especially those
written in perl. for example, to test a client or server written in perl,
one simply specifies code to launch the server on an arbitrary port and
provides corresponding code to execute a client to connect to it.

this module also supports running multiple servers in the same test file.
