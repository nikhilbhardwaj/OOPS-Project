Command line parsing library for ocaml
	
this package provides the getopt module that is an alternative to the
arg module in the standard distribution.  getopt supports the general
command line syntax of gnu getopt and getopt_long, but is close to the
spirit of the arg module: the programmer gives to the general parsing
function a list of possible options, together with the behavior of
these options.
