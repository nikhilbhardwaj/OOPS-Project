Logging, unittesting, and runtime diagnostics for c++ - development files
	
diagnostics is a unified framework for code annotation, logging,
program monitoring, and unit-testing.

the annotations of diagnostics provide simple trace messages, tracing
method entry and exit, checks (which potentially fail), asserts (which
should never fail), invariance checking on method entry and exit, and
a number of annotations for testing.

the annotations raise events which are can be observed and monitored.
using different loggers, the stream of logging events is used for
logging or testing.

the package contains the needed headers and libraries for
developing software using diagnostics.
