Userspace fault injection framework
	
libfiu is a c library for fault injection. it provides functions to mark
"points of failure" inside your code (the "core api"), and functions to
enable/disable the failure of those points (the "control api").

this package contains the libfiu shared library. to perform fault injection,
you will require the "libfiu-dev" package.
