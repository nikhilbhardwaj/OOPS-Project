Temperature sensor dockapp for window maker
	
wmgtemp is a dock app (a 64x64 window) which graphically displays the
cpu and sys temperatures of motherboards supported by lm_sensors.

to make wmgtemp work, one needs to set up lm_sensors and i2c.
on debian systems, the lm-sensors-source and i2c-source packages
are used to set these up.
