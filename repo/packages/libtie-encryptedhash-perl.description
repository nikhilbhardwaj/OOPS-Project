Module for encrypted hashes and objects based on hashes
	
tie::encryptedhash is a perl module that enables hashes (and objects based on
hashes) with automatically encrypting fields. when the password is not set,
an encrypted hash behaves exactly like a standard perl hash, which is useful
for serializing the resulting data.
