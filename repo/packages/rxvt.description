Vt102 terminal emulator for the x window system
	
rxvt is an 8-bit clean, color xterm replacement that uses significantly
less memory than a conventional xterm, mostly since it doesn't support
toolkit configurability or tek graphics, but also since features can
be removed at compile-time to reflect your needs.

the distribution also includes rclock, the smaller/better xclock
replacement with appointment scheduling and xbiff functionality.
