A wrapper that encrypts or signs outgoing mail
	
kuvert automatically signs and/or encrypts outgoing mail using
the pgp/mime standard (rfc3156), based on the availability
of the recipient's key in your keyring. other than similar wrappers,
kuvert does not store key passphrases itself, ever.
kuvert works as a wrapper around your mta but can be
fed mails via smtp, too.
