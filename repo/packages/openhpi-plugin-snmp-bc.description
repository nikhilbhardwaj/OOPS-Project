openhpi is an implementation of the service availability forum's hardware
platform interface specification.  (see http://www.saforum.org)  as
such, openhpi facilitates the development of computer manageability
applications which are not tied to a single hardware vendor's products.

this package contains a plugin module that accesses ibm bladecenter
and rsa-enabled systems hardware information through snmp.
