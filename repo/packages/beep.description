Advanced pc-speaker beeper
	
beep does what you'd expect: it beeps. but unlike printf "\a" beep allows
you to control pitch, duration, and repetitions. its job is to live inside
shell/perl scripts and allow more granularity than one has otherwise. it is
controlled completely through command line options. it's not supposed to be
complex, and it isn't - but it makes system monitoring (or whatever else it
gets hacked into) much more informative.
