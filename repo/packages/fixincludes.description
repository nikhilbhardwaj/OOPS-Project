Fix non-ansi header files
	
fixincludes was created to fix non-ansi system header files. many
system manufacturers supply proprietary headers that are not ansi compliant.
the gnu compilers cannot compile non-ansi headers. consequently, the
fixincludes shell script was written to fix the header files.

not all packages with header files are installed on the system, when the
package is built, so we make fixincludes available at build time of other
packages, such that checking tools like lintian can make use of it.
