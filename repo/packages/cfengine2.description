Tool for configuring and maintaining network machines
	
the main purpose of cfengine is to allow the system administrator
to create a single central file which will define how every host
on a network should be configured.

it takes a while to set up cfengine for a network (especially an
already existing network), but once that is done you will wonder
how you ever lived without it!
