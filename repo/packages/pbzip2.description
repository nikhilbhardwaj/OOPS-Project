Parallel bzip2 implementation
	
pbzip2 is a parallel implementation of the bzip2 block-sorting file
compressor that uses pthreads and achieves near-linear speedup on smp
machines. the output of this version is fully compatible with bzip2
v1.0.2 (ie: anything compressed with pbzip2 can be decompressed with
bzip2).
