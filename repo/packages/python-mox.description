A mock object framework for python
	
mox is a mock object framework for python that simplifies the writing of
unittests.

mox will make mock objects for you, so you don't have to create your
own. it mocks the public/protected interfaces of python objects. you set
up your mock objects expected behavior using a domain specific language
(dsl), which makes it easy to use, understand, and refactor.

it is based on easymock, a java mock object framework.
