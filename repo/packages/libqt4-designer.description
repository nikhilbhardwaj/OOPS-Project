Qt 4 designer module
	
qt is a cross-platform c++ application framework. qt's primary feature
is its rich set of widgets that provide standard gui functionality.

the qtdesigner module provides classes that allow you to create your own
custom widget plugins for qt designer, and classes that enable you to access
qt designer's components.
