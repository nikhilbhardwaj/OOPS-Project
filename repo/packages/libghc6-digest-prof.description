Efficient cryptographic hash implementations bytestrings; profiling library
	
this package provides a library for the haskell programming language,
compiled for profiling.
see http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on haskell.

this package provides efficient cryptographic hash implementations for strict
and lazy bytestrings. for now, crc32 and adler32 are supported; they are
implemented as ffi bindings to efficient code from zlib.
