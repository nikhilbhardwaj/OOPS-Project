The gnu parted disk partitioning shared library
	
gnu parted is a program that allows you to create, destroy,
resize, move and copy hard disk partitions. this is useful
for creating space for new operating systems, reorganising
disk usage, and copying data to new hard disks. this package
contains the parted binary and manual page.

this package contains libparted, the required shared library
used by parted. this is a cut-down package with no normal
documentation intended to be used in debian-installer.

parted currently supports dos, mac, sun, bsd, gpt, mips and
pc98 disklabels/partition tables, as well as a 'loop' (raw
disk) type which allows use on raid/lvm. filesystems which
are currently fully supported are ext2, ext3, fat (fat16
and fat32), reiserfs (with libreiserfs) and linux-swap.
parted can also detect and remove hfs (mac os), jfs, ntfs,
ufs (sun and hp), xfs and asfs/affs/apfs (amiga) filesystems,
but cannot create, resize or check these filesystems yet.

note that reiserfs support is only enabled if you install
the libreiserfs0.3-0 package. since libreiserfs0.3-0 has been
removed from sarge, reiserfs support is not compiled in the
default package.

the nature of this software means that any bugs could cause
massive data loss. while there are no known bugs at the moment,
they could exist, so please back up all important files before
running it, and do so at your own risk.
