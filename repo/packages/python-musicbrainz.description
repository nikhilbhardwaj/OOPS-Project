Second generation incarnation of the cd index - python bindings
	
musicbrainz indexes both digital compressed audio (mp3/ogg vorbis) and
digital audio cds.

this is a straight python to c binding for libmusicbrainz.  it uses ctypes
to avoid having to write c code.

these bindings are deprecated upstream.  you problably want the
python-musicbrainz2 package instead.
