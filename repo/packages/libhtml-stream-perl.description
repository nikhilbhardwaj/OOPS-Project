Html output stream class, and some markup utilities
	
the html::stream module provides you with an object-oriented
(and subclassable) way of outputting html.  basically, you open up
an "html stream" on an existing filehandle, and then do all of your
output to the html stream.  you can intermix html-stream-output and
ordinary-print-output, if you like.
