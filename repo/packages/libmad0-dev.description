Mpeg audio decoder development library
	
mad is an mpeg audio decoder. it currently only supports the mpeg 1
standard, but fully implements all three audio layers (layer i, layer ii,
and layer iii, the latter often colloquially known as mp3.)

this is the package you need to develop or compile applications that use mad.
