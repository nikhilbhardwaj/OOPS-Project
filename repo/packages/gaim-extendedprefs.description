Plugin for the instant messenger pidgin (transitional package)
	
the pidgin extended preferences plugin adds additional preferences that
have been commonly called for in the past from pidgin that are either
already implemented and hidden, or trivial to implement via a plugin.

this is a transitional dummy package to ensure clean upgrades from
old releases.  it can be safely removed after upgrade.
