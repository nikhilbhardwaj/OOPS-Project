The gambas extended gtk gui component
	
gambas is a programming language based on a basic interpreter with
object extensions - like visual basic, though it is not a clone!
it has many components for developing internationalized,
desktop-independent, database- and network-enabled applications.
even games can be developed very quickly using its rad environment.

these are new properties for the gtk components for gambas. at this
moment it only adds footers to the gridview control.
