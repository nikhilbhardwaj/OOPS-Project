Poe component providing tcp client services for test cases
	
test::poe::client::tcp is a poe component that provides a tcp client framework
for inclusion in client component test cases, instead of having to roll your
own.

once registered with the component, a session will receive events related to
connections made, disconnects, flushed output and input from the specified
server.
