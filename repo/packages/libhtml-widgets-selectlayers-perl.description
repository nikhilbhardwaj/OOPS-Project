Perl extension for selectable html layers
	
this module implements an html widget with multiple layers.  only one layer
is visible at any given time, controlled by a <select> box.  for an
example see http://www.420.am/selectlayers/

this html generated by this module uses javascript, but nevertheless attempts
to be as cross-browser as possible.  the 0.05 release drops navigator 4
compatibility and has been tested under mozilla firefox 1.0.6, msie 6.0,
konqueror 3.3.2, and opera 8.0.2.
