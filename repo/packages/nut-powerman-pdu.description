Network ups tools - powerman pdu driver
	
network ups tools (nut) is a client/server monitoring system that
allows computers to share uninterruptible power supply (ups) and
power distribution unit (pdu) hardware. clients access the hardware
through the server, and are notified whenever the power status
changes.

this package provides powerman-pdu, which allows nut clients to communicate
with the powerman daemon to support pdus.
