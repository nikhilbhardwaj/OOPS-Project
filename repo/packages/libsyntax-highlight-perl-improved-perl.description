Highlighting of perl syntactical structures
	
this module provides syntax highlighting for perl code. the design bias is
roughly line-oriented and streamed (ie, processing a file line-by-line in a
single pass). provisions may be made in the future for tasks related to
"back-tracking" (ie, re-doing a single line in the middle of a stream) such
as speeding up state copying.
