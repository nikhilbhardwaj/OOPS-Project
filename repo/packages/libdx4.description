Opendx (ibm visualization data explorer) - shared libraries
	
data explorer is a system of tools and user interfaces for visualizing data.
in general terms the visualization of data can be considered a 3-stage
process:

   1. describing and importing data
   2. processing the data through a visualization program
   3. presenting the resulting image.

this is the package containing the shared libraries. programs that use
routines from the opendx classes usually depend on it.
