Arc java wrapper
	
the nordugrid is a collaboration aiming at development, maintenance
and support of the free grid middleware, known as the advanced
resource connector (arc).

developers with an interest to integrate the some functionality on a
remote site via an interface compatible with arc, may find it preferable
to perform that remote invocation from within java. while today most
services in arc are associated with computation or storage, there is
no constraint on these applications.
