Ocaml libraries for managing packages and their dependencies
	
dose2 is a framework made of several ocaml libraries for managing
distribution packages and their dependencies.

though not tied to any particular distribution, dose 2 constitutes a
pool of libraries which enable injecting packages coming from various
distribution. companion libraries (e.g. ceve) and tools (e.g.
pkglab) rely on dose2 to manage packages coming from various
distributions, e.g. debian and red hat.

besides basic functionalities for querying and setting package
properties, dose also implements algorithms for solving more complex
problems (monitoring package evolutions, correct and complete
dependency resolution, repository-wide uninstallability checks).

this package contains the development stuff you need to use dose2 in
the development of your programs.
