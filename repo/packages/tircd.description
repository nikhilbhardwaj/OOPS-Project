Ircd proxy to the twitter api
	
tircd presents twitter as an irc channel. you can connect to tircd
with any irc client, and twitter as if you were on irc.

to update your status on twitter, send a message to the #twitter
channel. when users you follow update their status, tircd will be sent
to the channel as a message from them. other actions are similarly
mapped to the equivalent irc commands and events.
