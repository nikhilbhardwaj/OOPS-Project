Remote network security auditor, the client
	
the openvas security scanner is a security auditing tool. it makes
possible to test security modules in an attempt to find vulnerable
spots that should be fixed.

it is made up of two parts: a server, and a client. the server/daemon,
openvasd, is in charge of the attacks, whereas the client,
openvas-client, provides the user a nice x11/gtk+ interface.

this package contains the gtk+ client.
