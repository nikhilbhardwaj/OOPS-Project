Grep utility that uses perl 5 compatible regexes.
	
perl-style regexps have many useful features that the standard posix ones
don't; this is basically the same as grep but with the different
regexp syntax.

the other reason for the existence of pcregrep is that its source code is an
example of programming with libpcre.
