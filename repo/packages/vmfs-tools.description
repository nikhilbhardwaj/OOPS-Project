Tools to access vmfs filesystems
	
vmfs is a clustered filesystem designed to store virtual machine disks for
vmware esx or esxi server hosts. this set of tools allows to access these
filesystems from some other non esx/esxi host for e.g. maintenance tasks.

only read access is available at the moment, but write access is under
works. multiple extents are supported.

the vmfs can be accessed with a command line tool or mounted through a
userspace filesystem (fuse-based).
