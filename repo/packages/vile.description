Vi like emacs - vi work-alike
	
vile is a text editor which is extremely compatible with vi in terms of
``finger feel''.  in addition, it has extended capabilities in many areas,
notably multi-file editing and viewing, syntax highlighting, key rebinding,
an optional embedded perl interpreter, and real x window system support.

this package contains the character-mode binary.  required support files
are contained in vile-common.  source code highlighting filters are in
vile-filters.  an x11 binary is in the xvile package.
