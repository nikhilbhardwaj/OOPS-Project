Convert mediawiki markup into other text formats
	
wikipedia and its sister projects use the php mediawiki to format
their pages. text::mediawikiformat attempts to duplicate the mediawiki
formatting rules. those formatting rules can be simple and easy to use, while
providing more advanced options for the power user. they are also easy to
translate into other, more complicated markup languages with this module. it
creates html by default, but could produce valid pod, docbook, xml, or any
other format imaginable.
