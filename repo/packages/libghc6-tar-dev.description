Reading, writing and manipulating ".tar" archive files
	
this package provides a library for the haskell programming language.
see http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on haskell.

this library is for working with ".tar" archive files. it can read and write a
range of common variations of archive format including v7, ustar, posix and
gnu formats. it provides support for packing and unpacking portable archives.
this makes it suitable for distribution but not backup because details like
file ownership and exact permissions are not preserved.
