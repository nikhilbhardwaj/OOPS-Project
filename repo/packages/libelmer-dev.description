Finite element multiphysics suite - development files
	
the elmer multiphysics simulation package includes physical models of
fluid dynamics, structural mechanics, electromagnetics, heat transfer, and
acoustics, among others. these are described by partial differential equations
which elmer solves by the finite element method (fem).

elmer uses metis (or its free counterpart scotch) for mesh partitioning, and
(p)arpack, umfpack, blas/lapack, and hypre to solve the sparse linear systems
resulting from fem discretization. it includes pre- and post-processors, and
several examples illustrating simulation of various physical phenomena.

elmer's lead institution is csc in collaboration with finnish universities,
research institutes, and industry.

this package contains the static libraries and header files for eio, huti, and
matc, as well as the elmer solver shared library symlink. these are used for
developing elmer, and are not needed to run the software.
