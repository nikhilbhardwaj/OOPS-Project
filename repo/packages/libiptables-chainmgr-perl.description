Perl extension for manipulating iptables policies
	
the "iptables::chainmgr" package provides an interface to manipulate iptables
policies on linux systems through the direct execution of iptables commands.

then, it is easy to execute iptables commands directly in order to both parse
and change the configuration of the policy. further, this simplifies
installation since the only external requirement is (in the spirit of
scripting) to be able to point iptables::chainmgr at an installed iptables
binary instead of having to compile against a library.
