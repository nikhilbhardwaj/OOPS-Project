Gnupg enabled mailing list manager with remailer-capabilities
	
schleuder is designed as a tool for group communication: subscribers
can communicate encrypted (and pseudonymously) among themselves, receive
emails from non-subscribers and send emails to non-subscribers via the list.

schleuder takes care of all decryption and encryption, stripping of headers,
formatting conversions, etc. schleuder can also send out its own public key
upon request and process administrative commands by email.
