Sundials development files
	
the family of solvers referred to as sundials (suit of nonlinear and
differential/algebraic equation solvers) consists of solvers cvode
(for ode systems), cvodes (ode with sensitivity analysis capabilities),
ida (for differential-algebraic systems), and kinsol (for nonlinear
algebraic systems).

this package contains files necessary for development applications using
sundials in c and, in case of fcvode and fkinsol, fortran.  it also
contains various example programs distributed by the upstream authors.
