Simple text editor from alpine, a text-based email client
	
"pico" is a simple but powerful text editor.  it was originally the pine
composer,  the editor used by the pine email client for writing email messages.

it has gained popularity since its initial use in that context and is now used
as a stand-alone editor by many users.

it is similar to but less powerful than gnu nano, an editor created with the
pico interface when the pico license was non-free.
