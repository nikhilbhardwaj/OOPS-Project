Extended persistence framework for session data
	
apache::sessionx extends apache::session. it was initialy written to use
apache::session inside html::embperl, but it seems to be useful outside of
embperl as well, so here it is as a standalone module. apache::sessionx
provides lazy creation of sessions, and an easier configuration using canned
locking and storage combinations.
