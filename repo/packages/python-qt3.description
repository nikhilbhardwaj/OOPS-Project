Qt3 bindings for python
	
python binding module that allows use of qt x window toolkit v3.
you can use it to create portable graphics-capable scripts (there
are pyqt versions for linux, windows and macos x).

at this moment pyqt offers a vast subset of qt api. there are
some minor issues related to the differences between c++ and python
(types, etc), but usually you'll be able to write code pretty the
same way in both languages (with syntax differences, of course)
