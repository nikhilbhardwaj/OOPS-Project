Api documentation for tagsoup
	
documentation for tagsoup, a sax-compliant parser written in java that instead
of parsing well-formed or valid xml, parses html as it is found in the wild:
poor, nasty and brutish, though quite often far from short. tagsoup is designed
for people who have to process this stuff using some semblance of a
rational application design.
