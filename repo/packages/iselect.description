An interactive line selection tool for ascii files
	
iselect is an interactive line selection tool for ascii files, operating
via a full-screen curses-based terminal session. it can be used either as
an user interface frontend controlled by a bourne-shell/perl/tcl backend
as its control script or in batch mode as a pipeline filter (usually
between grep and the final executing command).
