Perl module to validate parameters to perl method/function calls
	
params::validate is a perl module providing a flexible way to validate method
and function call parameters. the validation can be as simple as checking for
the presence of required parameters, or more complex, like validating object
classes (via isa) or capabilities (via can) and checking parameter types. it
also provides extensibility through customized validation callbacks.

the module has been designed to work equally well with positional or named
parameters (via a hash or hash reference) and includes experimental support
for attributes (see attribute::params::validate for details).
