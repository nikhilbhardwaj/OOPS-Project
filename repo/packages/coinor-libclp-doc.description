Coin-or linear programming solver
	
clp (coin-or linear programming) is an open-source linear programming solver
written in c++. it is primarily meant to be used as a callable library, but a
basic, stand-alone executable version is also available. it is designed to
find solutions of constrained linear mathematical optimization problems.

this package contains the documentation and examples.
