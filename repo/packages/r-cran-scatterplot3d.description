Gnu r package for visualizing multivariate data
	
scatterplot3d is a gnu r package for the visualization of multivariate data
in a three dimensional space. basically, scatterplot3d generates a scatter plot
in the 3d space using a parallel projection. higher dimensions (fourth, fifth,
etc.) of the data can be visualized to some extent using, e.g. different
colors, symbol types or symbol sizes.
