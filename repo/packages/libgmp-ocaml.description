Ocaml bindings for the gnu multiprecision arithmetic library
	
this package provides bindings for the gnu multiprecision library
(gnu mp) for the language ocaml (caml.inria.fr).  it is mostly a 1-1 mapping
of the c functions into the ocaml namespace, but also includes some
infix operators to make for a cleaner syntax.

this package provides the shared library for running applications linked
against libgmp-ocaml
