Record interaction with websites
	
http::recorder allows your perl program to record the interaction with
websites (ssl and non-ssl). you set http::recorder as the user agent for
a proxy, and it will rewrite http responses so that additional requests
can be recorded.

the interaction is recorded in a script suitable for www::mechanize. if
a javascript-enabled browser is being used, the script can be examined
an modified as it is being recorded.
