Perl module for creating xml from a dbi datasource
	
this module is a simple creator of xml data from dbi datasources.  it
allows you to easily extract data from a database, and manipulate
later using xml::parser.

binary data is encoded using utf-8.  this is automatically decoded
when parsing with xml::parser.

the examples need libxml-parser-perl.
