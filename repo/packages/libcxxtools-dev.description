Library of unrelated but useful c++ classes
	
cxxtools contains an argument-parser, a base-64 encoder/decoder, a
c++ interface to iconv, md5-stream for easy md5 calculation,
threading classes, socket classes, a dynamic exception-safe buffer, a
wrapper for dlopen/dlsym, a pool template (e.g., for a connection
pool in a multi-threaded application), query_params, and a class for
easy parsing of cgi parameters (get and post) in a cgi program.

this package has the development headers and the static libraries.
