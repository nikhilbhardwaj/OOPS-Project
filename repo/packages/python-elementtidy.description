An html tree builder for elementtree based on tidy
	
the elementtidy parser can read (almost) arbitrary
html files, and turn them into well-formed element trees.
this parser uses a library version of dave raggett's
html tidy utility to fix any problems with the html before
converting it to xhtml (the xml version of html).
