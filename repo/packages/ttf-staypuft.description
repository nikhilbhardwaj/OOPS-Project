The stay-puft free truetype font
	
stay-puft is a font developed freehand, with minimal splines. it's all
rounded and a sort of marshmallowy, so the author thought on it as the
stay-puft marshmallow font (see ghostbusters if you don't get it).
the outcome looks sort of like comic sans ms. it's kind of cute, and
might be good for frivolous stuff such as birthday cards.

it covers only languages using latin1 (iso-8859-1).
