Unconstrained non-linear optimization toolkit for octave
	
unconstrained non-linear optimization toolkit for octave, a numerical
computation software. included are functions to do linear least
square fitting on data points, nonlinear regression using the
levenberg-marquardt algorithm, prony's method for non-linear exponent
fitting and many more.

this octave add-on package is part of the octave-forge project.
