Program to display system news
	
the news command keeps you informed of news concerning the system.
each news item is contained in a separate file in the /var/lib/sysnews
directory. anyone having write permission to this directory can create
a news file.

note: this command has nothing to do with usenet news. it's more like an
enhanced motd.
