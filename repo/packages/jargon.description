The definitive compendium of hacker slang
	
this is the jargon file, a comprehensive compendium of hacker slang
illuminating many aspects of hackish tradition, folklore, and humor.
the file is in info format, but includes an html page with links
to the home site.

note that this package is now out-of-date, because the upstream author
is no longer maintaining an info version of the file.
