X window system utility programs metapackage
	
xutils provides a set of utility programs shipped with the x window system.
many of these programs are useful even on a system that does not have any x
clients or x servers installed.

this package is provided for transition from earlier debian releases, the
programs formerly in xutils and xbase-clients having been split out in smaller
packages.
