Teredo ipv6 tunneling server
	
the teredo ipv6 tunneling protocol encapsulates ipv6 packets into udp/ipv4
datagrams, to allow hosts behind nat devices to access the ipv6 internet.

miredo-server provides a teredo server. teredo servers help teredo clients
determine their nat configuration, maintain their nat binding, and perform
hole punching when transmitting ipv6 packets to other teredo clients and/or
teredo relays.
