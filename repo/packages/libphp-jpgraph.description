Object oriented graph library for php5
	
jpgraph is an object oriented class library for php5. jpgraph makes
it easy to draw both "quick and dirty" graphs with a minimum of code
and complex professional graphs which requires a very fine grain
control. jpgraph is equally well suited for both scientific and
business type of graphs. though claimed as non php5 works perfectly
for all samples with php5. this is the last gpled version,
more recent version are non dfsg complianti (see copyright file).
