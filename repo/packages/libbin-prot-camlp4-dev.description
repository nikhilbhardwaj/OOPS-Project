Type-safe binary serialization for ocaml values
	
bin-prot provides functionalities for reading and writing ocaml-values
in a type-safe binary protocol.

these functions provide a safe way of performing i/o on any
extensionally defined data type. functions, objects, and values whose
type is bound through a polymorphic record field are not supported, but
everything else is.

there is no support for cyclic or shared values and only little endian
computer architectures are supported.
