4.4bsd re-implementation of vi
	
vi is the original screen based text editor for unix systems.
it is considered the standard text editor, and is available on
almost all unix systems.

nvi is intended as a "bug-for-bug compatible" clone of the original
bsd vi editor. as such, it doesn't have a lot of snazzy features as do
some of the other vi clones such as elvis and vim. however, if all
you want is vi, this is the one to get.
