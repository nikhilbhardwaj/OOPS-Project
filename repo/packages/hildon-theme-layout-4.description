A layout file for making themes for the maemo 4 platform
	
this package contains tools that can help you create a theme for
the maemo platform version 4. it contains a gtkrc template for themes.
this works by maintaining a single gtkrc template (which is closely
tied with the code) and implement different themes by only drawing a
single png file.
