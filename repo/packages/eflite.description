Festival-lite based emacspeak speech server
	
eflite is a speech server for emacspeak and other screen readers that
allows them to interface with festival lite, a free text-to-speech
engine developed at the cmu speech center as an off-shoot of festival.

due to limitations inherited from its backend, eflite does only provide
support for the english language at the moment.
