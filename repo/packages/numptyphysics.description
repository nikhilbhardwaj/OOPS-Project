Crayon based physics puzzle game
	
numpty physics is a drawing puzzle game in the spirit (and style?) of
crayon physics using the same excellent box2d engine.  it melds cute
schoolbook-style graphics with a kind of realistic physics engine.

it includes a built-in editor so that you may build (and submit) your
own levels.
