Perl extension for manipulating ipv4/ipv6 addresses
	
this package contains the net::ip module, which provides functions
to deal with ipv4/ipv6 addresses. the module can be used as a class,
allowing the user to instantiate ip objects, which can be single ip
addresses, prefixes, or ranges of addresses. there is also a procedural
way of accessing most of the functions. most subroutines can take either
ipv4 or ipv6 addresses transparently.
