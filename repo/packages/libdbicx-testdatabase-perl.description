Create a temporary database from a dbix::class::schema
	
this module creates a temporary sqlite database, deploys your dbic
schema, and then connects to it.  this lets you easily test your dbic
schema.  since you have a fresh database for every test, you don't
have to worry about cleaning up after your tests, ordering of tests
affecting failure, etc.
