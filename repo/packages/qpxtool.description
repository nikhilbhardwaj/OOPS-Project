Cd/dvd quality checker
	
qpxtool gives you access to all available quality checks (q-checks) on written
and blank media, that are available for your drive. this will help you to find
the right media and the optimized writing speed for your hardware, which will
increase the chance for a long data lifetime.

qpxtool depends on the used drive, not all drives are able to read the q-checks
and not all of them are supported by qpxtool. currently, most newer drives of
liteon, nec, pioneer and plextor are supported.
