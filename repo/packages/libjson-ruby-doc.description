Json library for ruby (documentation)
	
this library implements the json (javascript object notation) specification in
ruby, allowing the developer to easily convert data between ruby and json. you
can think of it as a low fat alternative to xml, if you want to store data to
disk or transmit it over a network rather than use a verbose markup language.

this is the documentation package, with upstream documentation as well as
generated rdoc.
