Scheme control for network interfaces
	
ifscheme allows you to change network configuration schemes or query the
current scheme. it integrates with the ifup(8) command and interfaces(5). for
example, you might use this program to configure a "home" scheme and a "work"
scheme for a network device on a laptop. when you move between home and work,
a simple command can reconfigure your networking.
