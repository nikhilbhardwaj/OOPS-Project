Raster fonts for jsmath plugin spriteimagefonts
	
rasterized fonts saved in separate image files -- 1 image per font to
enable viewing of jsmath pages by a web-browser which is missing
access to tex fonts. sprite organization of raster fonts elivates the
problem of jsmath-fonts, which is a tremendous number of images since
each character has a separate image file. but such advantage comes at
speed and compatibility cost.
