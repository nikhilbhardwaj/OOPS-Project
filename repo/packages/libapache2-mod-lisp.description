An apache2 module that interfaces with lisp environments
	
establishes a link between the apache2 web server and a lisp environment
that allows a lisp program to generate dynamic content while letting
apache2 take care of the dirty details of http serving.  the protocol
between lisp and apache2 is simple, making it easy to create www-
accessible applications quickly.
