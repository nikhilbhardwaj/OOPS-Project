Network serial port client software for cyclades terminal servers
	
this is the client for network serial port emulation via the rfc 2217
protocol as used by cyclades terminal servers and other products.  it
consists of a daemon that manages a pseudo-tty and a shared object to take
over the tcsetattr() and tcsendbreak() library calls to redirect their
functionality over the network.
