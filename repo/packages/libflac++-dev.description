Free lossless audio codec - c++ development library
	
flac stands for free lossless audio codec. grossly oversimplified, flac is
similar to mp3, but lossless.  the flac project consists of:


 * the stream format
 * libflac, which implements a reference encoder, stream decoder, and file
   decoder
 * flac, which is a command-line wrapper around libflac to encode and decode
   .flac files
 * input plugins for various music players (winamp, xmms, and more in the
   works)


this package contains the development library libflac++.
