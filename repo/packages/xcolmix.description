An rgb colour mixer
	
xcolmix enables you to mix your own colours in order to determine three
values (the r/g/b code, or red-green-blue mix) of a colour. you can use
those colours to, e.g., define the foreground or background of x
applications which support it. furthermore, xcolmix lets you retrieve rgb
values from the x system's database of `predefined' colours.
