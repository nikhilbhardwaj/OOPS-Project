Debian jr. arcade games
	
this metapackage will install arcade games suitable, in the
opinion of the contributors to the debian jr. project, for children
of all ages.  mastering most of these games requires dexterity
and cognitive skills usually developed only in the older children
(around ages 5 to 8).  but the youngest children may enjoy watching
older players, or just poking randomly at the controls, depending
on the game.
