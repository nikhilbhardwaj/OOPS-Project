Gnu r package for date handling
	
this cran package provides functions for handling dates, along with
examples and documentation.

note that this is a legacy package providing functionality that had
been absent from r. however, more recent versions of r have more
powerful date and datetime functionality in the base package, i.e.
r-base-core under debian.
