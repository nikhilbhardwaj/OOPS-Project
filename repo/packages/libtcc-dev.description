Fast library for dynamic code generation
	
libtcc is a library that uses tcc, a compiler several times faster than
'gcc -o0' to perform dynamic code generation. it exposes in its api all
operations tcc performs to generate a binary from sources: setting
header and library paths, compiling program from a source file,
manipulating its symbols and handling relocation of its code among
other things. libtcc is also able to compile from a buffer.

this package contains the static library and header file for tcc (tiny
c compiler).

note: libtcc is still somewhat experimental and is not recommended for
production use.  the code it generates is much less optimized than what
gcc produces, and compiler bugs can have serious security consequences
for your program.
