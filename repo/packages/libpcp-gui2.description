Performance co-pilot graphical client tools library
	
the libpcp-gui package contains the runtime environment required by any
monitoring tool that makes use of the time control services of pmtime(1).

the performance co-pilot provides a unifying abstraction for
all of the interesting performance data in a system, and allows
client applications to easily retrieve and process any subset of
that data.
