Ggz gaming zone: game backend library
	
the ggzdmod library implements the communication between the main ggz
server (ggzd) and the game servers.  games use it to receive information
about themselves, to report back results and savegames, and to control
other run-time aspects.

this package provides the run-time library used by most of the ggz game
servers.

this package is part of the ggz gaming zone, a multiuser networked
gaming environment.
