An elf object file access library
	
the elf library provides routines to access, and manipulate, elf object
files. it is still not complete, but is required for a number of programs,
such as eli (a state of the art compiler generation system), and elk (the
extension language kit - an implementation of the scheme programming
language.)

this shared library may be needed by pre-packaged programs. to compile
programs with this library, you will need to install the libelfg0-dev
package as well.
