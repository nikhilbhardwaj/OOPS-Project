Certification authority written in python
	
pyca is a set of python scripts written michael str√∂der. they provide an
almost fully fledged  certification authority.
support for issueing email and authentication certificates works fine.

most notably spooling of requests and certificates between the public and
the private parts of the ca remains to be written.

other than that the documentation and scripts provided are of good quality
and may facilitate using and understanding the ca capabilities of openssl.

the required webserver must provide cgi support.
