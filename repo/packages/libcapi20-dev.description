if you have an isdn card with which capi works, you may be able to use
capi-capable applications such as fax systems. at this point, avm cards can
work with capi, as well as some active cards. for the avm passive cards you
need to visit the www.avm.de website.

this package provides files needed for development of capi-aware software.
