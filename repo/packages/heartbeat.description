Subsystem for high-availability linux
	
heartbeat is a basic heartbeat subsystem for linux-ha which implements
serial, udp, and ppp/udp heartbeats together with ip address takeover
including a nice resource model including resource groups.

it currently supports a very sophisticated dependency model for n-node
clusters. it is both extremely useful and quite stable at this point in
time.
