Composition tool for doom-style wad files
	
deu's texture companion (deutex) is a resource editor that
can extract and insert graphics, sounds, levels and other
resources in doom-format wad (where's all the data?) files.

deutex is command-line oriented and is most useful for
assembling wad files as part of a build procedure, such as
via makefile.
