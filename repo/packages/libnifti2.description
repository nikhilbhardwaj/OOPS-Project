Io libraries for the nifti-1 data format
	
niftilib is a set of i/o libraries for reading and writing files in the
nifti-1 data format. nifti-1 is a binary file format for storing medical
image data, e.g. magnetic resonance image (mri) and functional mri (fmri)
brain images.

this package contains the shared library of the low-level io library niftiio,
low-level io library znzlib and the nifticdf shared library that provides
functions to compute cumulative distributions and their inverses.
