X86-64 machine check exceptions collector and decoder
	
starting with version 2.6.4, the linux kernel for x86-64 no longer decodes
and logs recoverable machine check exception events to the kernel log on
its own.

instead, the mce data is kept in a buffer which can be read from userspace
via the /dev/mcelog device node.

you need this tool to collect and decode those events; it will log the decoded
mce events to syslog.
