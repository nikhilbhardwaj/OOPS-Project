Converts dicom files into the nifti format
	
the dinifti program converts mri images stored in dicom format to nifti
format. the nifti format is thought to be the new standard image format for
medical imaging and can be used with for example with fsl, afni, spm, caret
or freesurfer.

dinifti converts single files, but also supports fully automatic batch
conversions of complete dicomdirs. additionally, converted nifti files can
be properly named, using image series information from the dicom files.
