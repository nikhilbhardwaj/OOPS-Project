X509 certification authority management tool for gnome
	
gnomint is a tool for easily creating and managing certification authorities.
it provides fancy visualization of all the pieces of information that pertain
to a ca, such as x509 certificates, csrs, and crls.

gnomint is currently capable of managing a ca that emits certificates that are
able to authenticate people or machines in vpns (ipsec or other protocols),
secure http communications with ssl/tls, authenticate and cipher http
communications through web-client certificates, and sign or crypt email
messages.
