Colorful console interface for cvs version control
	
curves performs two functions.  it provides a menu and command
completion interface to cvs so that inexperienced users can learn the
features of cvs without documentation.  this includes the creation of
some meta-features built upon standard cvs commands that commonly are
used together.  the second function of curves is to provide visual
presentation of a project directory so that the status of each file
is comprehensible at a glance.  curves uses color, when available, to
accent the file classification marks.
