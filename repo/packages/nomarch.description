Unpacks .arc and .ark ms-dos archives
	
this is a de-archiving only replacement for the arc archiver from sea.  it
can handle pkarc archives, as well as others.  it can also be used with
emacs - see the nomarch manpage.

this package is very useful for e-mail virus scanner scripts for attachement
unpacking.
