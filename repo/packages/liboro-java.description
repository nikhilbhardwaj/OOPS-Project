Regular expression library for java
	
the jakarta-oro java classes are a set of text-processing java classes
that provide perl5 compatible regular expressions, awk-like regular
expressions, glob expressions, and utility classes for performing
substitutions, splits, filtering filenames, etc.
oro is faster and more functional than gnu.regexp.
