Burn audio cds directly from mp3, ogg vorbis, or flac files
	
mp3burn is a perl script that allows you to burn audio cds composed
of mp3, ogg vorbis, or flac tracks without an intermediate file conversion
to .cdr or .wav.
the .mp3/.ogg/.flac files *are* converted using a decoder, but are
written to fifos so they don't consume filesystem space during the burn.
