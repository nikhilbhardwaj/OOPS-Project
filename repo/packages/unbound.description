Validating, recursive, caching dns resolver
	
unbound is a recursive-only caching dns server which can perform dnssec
validation of results. it implements only a minimal amount of authoritative
service to prevent leakage to the root nameservers: forward lookups for
localhost, reverse for 127.0.0.1 and ::1, and nxdomain for zones served by
as112. stub and forward zones are supported.

this package contains the unbound daemon.
