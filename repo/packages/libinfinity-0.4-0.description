libinfinity is library to build collaborative text editors.  changes
to the text buffers are synced to all other clients over a central server.
even though a central server is involved, the local user sees his changes
applied instantly and the merging is done on the individual clients.

this package contains the shared object files used at runtime by
libinfinity-based application.
