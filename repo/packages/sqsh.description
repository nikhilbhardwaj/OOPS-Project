Commandline sql client for ms sql and sybase servers
	
sqsh is a flexible commandline utility that uses the freetds libraries
to connect to sybase or microsoft sql servers.  it is a useful debugging
tool for identifying problems with other sql applications, and it can be
used as a productivity tool in its own right:  unlike most sql clis, sqsh's
interactive shell lets you pipe the output of sql queries directly to other
unix commands for further processing.
