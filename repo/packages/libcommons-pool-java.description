Pooling implementation for java objects
	
pool provides an object-pooling api, with three major aspects:

 1. a generic object pool interface that clients and implementors can use to
    provide easily interchangeable pooling implementations.
 2. a toolkit for creating modular object pools.
 3. several general purpose pool implementations.
