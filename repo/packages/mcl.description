The markov cluster algorithm
	
the mcl package is an implementation of the mcl algorithm, and offers
utilities for manipulating sparse matrices (the essential data
structure in the mcl algorithm) and conducting cluster experiments.

mcl is currently being used in sciences like biology (protein family
detection, genomics), computer science (node clustering in
peer-to-peer networks), and linguistics (text analysis).
