Unicode string library for c - development files
	
the 'libunistring' library implements unicode strings (in the utf-8,
utf-16, and utf-32 encodings), together with functions for unicode
characters (character names, classifications, properties) and
functions for string processing (formatted output, width, word
breaks, line breaks, normalization, case folding, regular
expressions).

this package contains the development support files needed to compile
and link against libunistring, as well as the documentation in info
and html format.
