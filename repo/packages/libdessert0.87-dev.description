Header file and documentation for libdessert0.87
	
this packet contains the header file and documentation for the libdessert
library.

des-sert is a framework written as ansi-c library. while generally
usable in many application scenarios, it is primarily used in des-mesh,
the multi-transceiver wireless mesh network testbed part of the
des-testbed. des-sert enables the implementation of routing protocols
via an underlay in user space.

des-sert routing daemons utilize libpcap to receive packets from the
network resp. to send them. locally generated packets or packets destined
to this host use a tun or tap interface as access point to the operating
system protocol stack.
