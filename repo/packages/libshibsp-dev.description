Federated web single sign-on system (development)
	
the shibboleth system is a standards based software package for web
single sign-on across or within organizational boundaries.  it supports
authorization and attribute exchange using the oasis saml 2.0 protocol.
shibboleth allows sites to make informed authorization decisions for
individual access of protected online resources while allowing users to
establish their identities with their local authentication systems.

this package contains the headers and other necessary files to build
applications that use the shibboleth sp library.
