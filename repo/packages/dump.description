4.4bsd dump and restore for ext2 filesystems
	
dump examines files on a filesystem and determines which files need to be
backed up.  these files are copied to the given disk, tape or other storage
medium for safe keeping.

the restore command performs the inverse function of dump.  a full backup of
a file system may be restored and subsequent incremental backups layered on
top of it.  single files and directory subtrees may be restored from full or
partial backups.
