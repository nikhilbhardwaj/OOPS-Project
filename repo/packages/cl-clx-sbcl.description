An x11 common lisp client library for sbcl
	
clx is a low-level x11 client library for common lisp.  clx is to lisp what
xlib is to c.

this version of clx originated in a cmucl distribution, was modified in order
to make it compile and run under sbcl and was enhanced with some features from
other clx implementations.  it currently runs only on sbcl, but it might be
ported to other common lisp implementations.
