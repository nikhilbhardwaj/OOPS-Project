Server and game logic for the game openarena
	
openarena is an open-source content package for ioquake3 licensed under the
gpl, effectively creating a free stand-alone game. though openarena is a free
replacement for id software inc.'s quake 3 arena, it is not compatible with
the proprietary game!

this package installs the openarena dedicated server, and the game logic files
needed by both the client and the server.
