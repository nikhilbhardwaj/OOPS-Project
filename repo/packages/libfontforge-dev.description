Font editor - runtime library (development files)
	
besides being a font editor, fontforge is also a font format
converter, and can convert among postscript (ascii & binary type 1,
some type 3s, some type 0s), truetype, and opentype (type2),
cid-keyed, svg, cff and multiple-master fonts.

this package contains the runtime library's development files.
