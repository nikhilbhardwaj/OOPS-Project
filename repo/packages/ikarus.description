Scheme compiler and interpreter
	
ikarus is a compiler-based implementation of the scheme programming
language which targets the i386 (with sse2) architecture.  it has
good performance, is rather light weight, is case-sensitive, and
implements a substantial portion of the language described in r6rs.
