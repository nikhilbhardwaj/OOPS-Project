Generic proxy wrapper type for python
	
mxproxy is an extension package that provides a new type that is
suitable to implement bastion like features without the need to use
restricted execution environments.

given that current python versions no longer support bastion or rexec
as secure sand-box execution models, mxproxy fills an important
gap. it also gives the programmer more control over how and to what
extent access should be controlled or not.
