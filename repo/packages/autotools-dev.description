Update infrastructure for config.{guess,sub} files
	
this package installs an up-to-date version of config.guess and
config.sub, used by the automake and libtool packages.  it provides
the canonical copy of those files for other packages as well.

it also documents in /usr/share/doc/autotools-dev/readme.debian.gz
best practices and guidelines for using autoconf, automake and
friends on debian packages.  this is a must-read for any developers
packaging software that uses the gnu autotools, or gnu gettext.

additionally this package provides seamless integration into debhelper
or cdbs, allowing maintainers to easily update config.{guess,sub} files
in their packages.
