Module to query cddb and freedb servers
	
cddb protocol servers provide compact disc information for programs that need
it. this allows such programs to display disc and track titles automatically
and it provides extended information like liner notes and lyrics. with this
module, a perl program can identify and possibly gather details about a disc
based on its "table of contents" (the disc's track times and offsets).

disc details have been useful for generating cd catalogs, naming mp3 files,
printing cd liners, or even just playing discs in an automated jukebox.
