An alternative project manager for geany
	
geanyprj is a plugin for geany that provides an alternative method for managing
projects in geany, which moves away from geany's default project management
style, which is session-based, instead implementing a system which
automatically opens a project when oen of its files are opened.

geany is a small and lightweight integrated development environment using the
gtk+ toolkit.
