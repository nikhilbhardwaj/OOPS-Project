Web-oriented universal programming language
	
programming language similar to javascript, but with full-featured
static type system and generics.  the command-line compiler can
generate flash swf files for client-side use, neko bytecode for
server-side use on apache, or javascript/php using browser dhtml api
to create ajax web applications.
