Perl script useful for managing patches
	
patcher is a patch manager that keeps track of which files you change.
it then can generate patches from your changes, no need for you to
handle the diff tool manually.

the patches can be stacked in series, they define the order they have to
be applied. patcher keeps series information as well as information of
which patches have been applied and which not.
