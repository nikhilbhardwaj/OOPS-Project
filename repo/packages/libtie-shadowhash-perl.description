Merge multiple data sources into a hash
	
shadowhash merges together multiple sets of data in the form of hashes into a
data structure that looks to perl like a single simple hash. when that hash
is accessed, the data structures managed by that shadow hash are searched in
order they were added for that key. this allows the rest of a program simple
and convenient access to a disparate set of data sources.
