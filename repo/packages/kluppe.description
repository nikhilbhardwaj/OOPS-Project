A loop-player and recorder designed for live use
	
kluppe is written in c and uses jack, gtk and sndfile. features include:


 - multiple files buffers, multiple 'loopers' tracks
 - direct (gui) access to all loopers
 - combined and per loop output ports for jack
 - different playmodes including "granular"


kluppe is the austrian word for clip and sounds even crazier if you loop it.
