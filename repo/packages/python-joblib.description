Tools to provide lightweight pipelining in python
	
joblib is a set of tools to provide lightweight pipelining in
python. in particular, joblib offers:

 - transparent disk-caching of the output values and lazy
   re-evaluation (memoize pattern)
 - easy simple parallel computing
 - logging and tracing of the execution


joblib is optimized to be fast and robust in particular on large,
long-running functions and has specific optimizations for numpy arrays.
