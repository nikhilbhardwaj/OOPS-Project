Stereo and mono lv2 plugins, four-band parametric equalisers
	
each section has an active/bypass switch, frequency, bandwidth and
gain controls. there is also a global bypass switch and gain control.
all switches and controls are internally smoothed, so they can be
used 'live' whithout any clicks or zipper noises. this should make
this plugin a good candidate for use in systems that allow automation
of plugin control ports, such as ardour, or for stage use.
