Background job killer
	
killer is a perl script that gets rid of background jobs. background
jobs are defined as processes that belong to users who are not currently
logged into the machine. jobs can be run in the background (and are
exempt from *killer*'s actions) if their scheduling priority has been
reduced by increasing their nice(1) value or if they are being run
through condor.

when the package is installed, a cron job is installed to run killer
once an hour.
