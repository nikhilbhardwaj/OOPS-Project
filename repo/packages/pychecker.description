Tool to find common bugs in python source code
	
pychecker is a tool for finding common bugs in python source code.
it finds problems that are typically caught by a compiler for less
dynamic languages, like c and c++. because of the dynamic nature of python,
some warnings may be incorrect; however, spurious warnings should be
fairly infrequent.
