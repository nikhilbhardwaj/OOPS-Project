Drive a car across the moon (version with sound)
	
moon-buggy is a simple character graphics game, where you drive some
kind of car across the moon's surface.  unfortunately there are
dangerous craters there.  fortunately your car can jump over them!

this version includes experimental support for sound and thus requires
a soundcard to run!
