Debugging symbols for boinc binaries
	
the berkeley open infrastructure for network computing (boinc) is a
software platform for distributed computing using volunteered computer
resources.

the boinc packages. it is provided primarily to provide a backtrace
with names in a debugger, this makes it somewhat easier to interpret
core dumps.
