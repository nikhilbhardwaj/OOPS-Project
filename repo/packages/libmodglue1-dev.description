Development files for a c++ library for handling of multiple co-processes
	
modglue is a c++ library with classes for forking external
processes and asynchronous reading from streams. it takes
away the burden of all subtleties involving the unix fork
call. the asynchronous read facility enables one to read on
multiple input streams at the same time, without losing any
of the standard c++ stream facilities.

this package contains the development header files.
