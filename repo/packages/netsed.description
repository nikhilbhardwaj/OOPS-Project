The network packet altering stream editor
	
netsed is small and handful utility designed to alter the contents of
packets forwarded thru your network in real time. it is really useful
for network hackers in following applications:


  * black-box protocol auditing - whenever there are two or more
    proprietary boxes communicating over undocumented protocol (by
    enforcing  changes in ongoing transmissions, you will be able to
    test if tested application is secure),



  * fuzz-alike experiments, integrity tests - whenever you want to test
    stability of the application and see how it ensures data integrity,



  * other common applications - fooling other people, content filtering,
    etc etc - choose whatever you want to.


it perfectly fits ngrep, netcat and tcpdump tools suite.
