Validating xml parser library for c++ (compiled samples)
	
xerces-c++ is a validating xml parser written in a portable subset of
c++.  this package contains compiled versions of the samples.  you
probably don't want this package, but it can be useful if you are
trying to reproduce a problem before reporting a bug that will be
easy for the xerces developers to reproduce.
