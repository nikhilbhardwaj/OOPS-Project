Debian security analyzer
	
debsecan is a tool to generate a list of vulnerabilities which affect
a particular debian installation.  debsecan runs on the host which is
to be checked, and downloads vulnerability information over the
internet.  it can send mail to interested parties when new
vulnerabilities are discovered or when security updates become
available.
