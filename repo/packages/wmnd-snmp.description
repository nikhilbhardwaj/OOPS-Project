Dockapp monitoring network interfaces with snmp support
	
shows a graph of incoming/outgoing traffic, activity indicators for rx/tx and
current/maximum rate for rx/tx in bytes or packets.

the snmp input driver can use any if-mib compliant data source such as
most routers and managed switches.

tailored for use with windowmaker, it will as well work with any other window
manager though.
