Linux traffic control language interpreter
	
using /sbin/tc (to configure linux network traffic flow control) is
painful. this package attempts to reduce the pain with two new input
languages (one for humans, and xml ;-). the output is xml, or /sbin/tc
commands to configure the kernel.

the "tcsim" traffic simulator is not included in debian.
