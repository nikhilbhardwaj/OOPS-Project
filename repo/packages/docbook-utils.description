Convert docbook files to other formats (html, rtf, ps, man, pdf)
	
the docbook-utils is a set of a few small programs intended to ease
everyday use of technical documentation software and more generally use of
sgml and xml.

tasks they currently accomplish are:

 * jw: convert docbook files to other formats (html, rtf, postscript, pdf).
 * sgmldiff: detect the differences in markup between two sgml files.
 * docbook2man: converts a docbook refentry to a man page.
