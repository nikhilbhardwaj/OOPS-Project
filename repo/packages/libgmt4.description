Generic mapping tools library
	
gmt libraries allow manipulating geographic and cartesian data sets
(including filtering, trend fitting, gridding, projecting, etc.) and
producing encapsulated postscript file (eps) illustrations ranging from
simple x-y plots via contour maps to artificially illuminated surfaces
and 3-d perspective views.
