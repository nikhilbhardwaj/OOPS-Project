Sends icmp echo_request packets to network hosts
	
fping is a ping like program which uses the internet control message protocol
(icmp) echo request to determine if a target host is responding.  fping
differs from ping in that you can specify any number of targets on the command
line, or specify a file containing the lists of targets to ping.  instead of
sending to one target until it times out or replies, fping will send out a
ping packet and move on to the next target in a round-robin fashion.
