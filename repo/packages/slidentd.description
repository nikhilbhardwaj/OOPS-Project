Minimal ident (rfc 1413) daemon
	
it is similar in the purpose to pidentd but with different design goals. it's
a very small and simple daemon that would not give out any sensitive
information. in this regard it is not rfc compliant (rfc 1413 requires the
daemon to be insecure by default).

slidentd is statically compiled (with dietlibc) and quite small (~2kb).
