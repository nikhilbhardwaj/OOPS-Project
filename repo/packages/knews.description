Graphical threaded news reader
	
knews is an x11 based thread-oriented news reader.  it is capable of
representing threads as a graphical tree, represents quotations with
different colors and much more.

also included here is knewsd, a tiny nntp daemon which can read news
from a spool directory or even from a mail folder hierarchy, for use
when you don't have a real server available.  there is no guarantee
that it will work with any client other than knews, so it is not
packaged separately.
