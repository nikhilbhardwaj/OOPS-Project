A graphical xen management tool
	
convirt is a xen management tool with a gtk+ based graphical interface
that allows for performing the standard set of domain operations
(start, stop, pause, kill, shutdown, reboot, snapshot, etc...). it
also attempts to simplify certain aspects such as the creation of
domains, as well as making the consoles available directly within the
tool's user interface.
