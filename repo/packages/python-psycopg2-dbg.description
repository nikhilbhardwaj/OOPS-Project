Python module for postgresql (debug extension)
	
psycopg is a postgresql database adapter for the python programming language
(just like pygresql and popy.) this is version 2, a complete rewrite of the
original code to provide new-style classes for connection and cursor objects
and other sweet candies. like the original, psycopg 2 was written with the
aim of being very small and fast, and stable as a rock.

this package contains the extensions built for the python debug interpreter.
