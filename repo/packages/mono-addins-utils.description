Command-line utility for mono.addins management
	
mono.addins is a framework for creating extensible cli applications, and for
creating libraries which extend those applications.
mono.addins has been designed to be easy to use and useful for a wide range
of applications: from simple applications with small extensibility needs, to
complex applications which need support for large add-in structures.

this package contains a command-line utility to easily manipulate mono.addins
registries provided by other software (including user-written applications).
