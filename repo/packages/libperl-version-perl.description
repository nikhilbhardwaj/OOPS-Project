Module to parse and manipulate perl version strings
	
perl::version provides a simple interface for parsing, manipulating and
formatting perl version strings.

unlike version.pm (which concentrates on parsing and comparing version
strings) perl::version is designed for cases where you'd like to parse a
version, modify it and get back the modified version formatted like the
original.
