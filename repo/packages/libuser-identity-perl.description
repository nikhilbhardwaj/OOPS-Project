Module to manage a person's identities/roles
	
user::identity is a perl module that provides a set of informational classes
which are related to one user. this module attempts to be smart at providing
defaults, conversions and often required combinations.

the identities do not implement any kind of storage, so they can be used by
any perl program. as a result, it is more flexible than an xml file to store
the data. for instance, you can choose to store the data using data::dumper,
storable, dbi, addressbook, etc.
