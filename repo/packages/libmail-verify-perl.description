Utility to verify an email address
	
mail::verify provides a function checkaddress function for verifying
email addresses. first the syntax of the email address is checked, then
it verifies that there is at least one valid mx server accepting email
for the domain. using net::dns and io::socket a list of mx records (or,
falling back on a hosts a record) are checked to make sure at least one
smtp server is accepting connections.
