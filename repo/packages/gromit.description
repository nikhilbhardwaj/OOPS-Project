Gtk based tool to make annotations on screen
	
gromit enables you to make annotations on your screen.

this is especially useful when making presentations, to highlight
things or point out things of interest.

gromit is xinput-aware, so if you have a graphic tablet you can
draw lines with different strength, color, erase things, etc.
