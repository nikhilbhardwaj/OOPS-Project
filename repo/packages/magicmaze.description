Rescue the maiden while avoiding the monsters
	
this is a simple game where you are a wizard searching the evil demon's
tower to try and rescue the beautiful maiden.  inspired by gauntlet ii,
your goal is to avoid/kill the monsters while trying to find the exit
and, eventually, the big boss who is holding your girlfriend captive.
includes support for playing in full-screen and with a joystick.
