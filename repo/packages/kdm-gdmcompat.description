Provide basic gdm functionality to systems running kdm
	
this package provides a gdmflexiserver replacement utility and a daemon
emulating gdm's control socket. the idea is to allow screen savers (especially
xscreensaver and gnome-screensaver) and desktops which depend on gdm, to
seamlessly integrate with kdm. the tools communicate with kdm via kdmctl.
