Provide metadata about software packages installed
	
app::info provides a generalized interface for providing metadata about
software packages installed on a system. the idea is that app::info subclasses
can be used in perl application installers in order to determine whether
software dependencies have been fulfilled, and to get necessary metadata about
those software packages.
