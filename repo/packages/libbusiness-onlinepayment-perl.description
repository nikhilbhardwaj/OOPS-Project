Perl extension for online payment processing
	
business::onlinepayment is a generic module for processing payments through
online credit card processors, online check acceptance houses, etc.  (if you
like buzzwords, call it an "multiplatform ecommerce-enabling middleware
solution").

important: business::onlinepayment only defines the frontend interface to the
system, in order to use it you also need to have at least one backend
processing module installed.
