Stripped-down versions of e2fsprogs, for debian-installer
	
this package is an e2fsprogs package built for a reduced size, so that
it can help to save space in debian-installer.

don't attempt to install this package, it has no support for a couple of
features you surely want.  anyway it should refuse to install.
