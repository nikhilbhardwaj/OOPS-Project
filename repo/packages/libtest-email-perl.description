Email contents test module
	
test::email provides tests for email contents; it is a subclass of
mime::entity with header_is, body_is, or _ok or _like and part_ok,
mime_type_ok methods. tests for equality remove trailing newlines from
strings before testing. some mail messages have newlines appended to them
during the mailing process, which could cause unnecessary confusion.

this package also provides test::pop3 to automate email delivery tests.
