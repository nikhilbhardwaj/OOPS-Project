A library that emulates sgi's gl routines under x11
	
ygl is an graphics library that emulates the routines of sgi's gl (sometimes
called iris gl). please note that gl is different from opengl.  ygl is very
simple to use, and very fast. the 2d routines are built around the standard
x11 libraries and reported to be faster than gl itself.  this release will
also work with fortran code and has been built with 3d support.  the library
therefore requires the use of the opengl libraries.

this package provides the development files.
