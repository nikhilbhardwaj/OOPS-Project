Flexi-streams: flexible bivalent streams for common lisp
	
flexi-streams implements "virtual" bivalent streams that can be layered
atop real binary or bivalent streams and that can be used to read and
write character data in various single- or multi-octet encodings which
can be changed on the fly. it also supplies in-memory binary streams
which are similar to string streams.

flexi-streams is currently not optimized towards performance - it is
rather intended to be easy to use and (if possible) to behave correctly.
