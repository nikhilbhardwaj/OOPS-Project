Tool for configuring linux wireless devices
	
this package contains the `iw' tool which allows you to configure and show
information about wireless networking.

in the future iw will become the canonical command line tool for wireless
configuration and iwconfig/wireless-tools will no longer be required. see
/usr/share/doc/iw/readme.debian for a more detailed overview of iw.
