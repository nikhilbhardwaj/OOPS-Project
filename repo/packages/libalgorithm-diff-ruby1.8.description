Ruby conversion of the perl's algorithm::diff (ruby 1.8)
	
diff is an algorithm which computes the differences between two
lists a and b. the resulting set of differences can be applied to
a (also called "patching") to get b. this is also what the unix
command line tools "diff" and "patch" are able to do.

this package is for ruby1.8.
