Fast image manipulation routines for the yorick language
	
compiled routines for basic but fast image manipulation in yorick (an
interpreted computer language specialized for numerical and scientific
problems). includes 2d bilinear and spline2 interpolation, clipping, 2d dist
generator, binning, image rotation, cartesian to polar coordinate transform,
gaussian and poisson random generator, fast sort and fast median. all of
these functions, with the exceptions of spline2, exist in yorick or the
yutils package, but these versions are 2 to 10x faster, being specialized for
2d arrays (hence the name imutil). this plugin is 64bits safe.
