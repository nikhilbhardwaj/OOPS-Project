Ncbi libraries for graphic biology applications (unstripped)
	
this package is useful to provide a backtrace with symbol names in a
debugger; this facilitates interpretation of core dumps, and aids in finding
logic errors in programs using the libraries in this package (or the
libraries themselves).

non-programmers will likely have little use for this package.  see the
libvibrant6a package for more information.
