Xlib/xcb interface library (development headers)
	
libx11-xcb provides functions needed by clients which take advantage of
xlib/xcb to mix calls to both xlib and xcb over the same x connection.

this package contains the development headers for the library found in
libx11-xcb1. non-developers likely have little use for this package.
