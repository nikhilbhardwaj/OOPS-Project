Perl module for testing scripts as subprocesses
	
test::script::run provides test::more-compatible subroutines for testing
scripts in a perl module distribution's bin/ directory using ipc::run3 to
spawn the scripts as subprocesses.

subroutines are provided for running scripts and simply checking that the
return value is good, as well as capturing a script's stdout and stderr and
comparing against expected output.
