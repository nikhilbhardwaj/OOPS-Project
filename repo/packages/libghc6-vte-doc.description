Binding to the vte library; documentation
	
this package provides the documentation for a library for the haskell
programming language.
see http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on haskell.

the vte library inserts terminal capability strings into a trie, and then uses
it to determine if data received from a pseudo-terminal is a control sequence
or just random data. the sample program interpret illustrates more or less
what the widget sees after it filters incoming data.
