Yet another abc to postscript converter
	
this program translates tunes written in the abc format to postscript,
which can then be viewed on screen or printed. it is essentially a
(non-exclusive) alternative to abc2ps, being based on the abc2ps
postscript code together with the abc parser from the abcmidi package.

people interested in this kind of software should also check out the
abcm2ps package, which contains a similar program that has lots of
additional features.
