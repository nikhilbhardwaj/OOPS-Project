Simple server to run cgi applications over fastcgi
	
fcgiwrap is a simple server for running cgi applications over fastcgi.
its goal is to provide clean cgi support to the nginx webserver, although
can be used with others.

fcgiwrap is lightweight and has no configuration, making it possible to
use the same pool to run different sites.
