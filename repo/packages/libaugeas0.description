The augeas configuration editing library and api
	
augeas is a configuration editing tool. it parses configuration files in their
native formats and transforms them into a tree. configuration changes are made
by manipulating this tree and saving it back into native config files.

the transformation works very hard to preserve comments and formatting
details. it is controlled by ``lens'' definitions that describe the file
format and the transformation into a tree.
