The netfilter userspace logging daemon
	
ulogd is a daemon that listens for netlink packets generated by iptables's
ulog target. basically, it's a replacement for syslog for logging packets,
and does a much better job - it logs to files, pcap files, mysql, postgresql,
sqlite 3 and soon will be able to log remotely.

mysql, postgresql and sqlite 3 support is in separate packages, called
ulogd-mysql, ulogd-pgsql and ulogd-sqlite3 respectively. pcap file support
is in package called ulogd-pcap.
