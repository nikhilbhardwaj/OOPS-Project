Single interval mathematics package for octave
	
this package define the basic operations on intervals using octave, a
scientific computation software.  intervals can be used instead of
floating point number to automatically take into account the
tolerance of the values used in calculation.  it is useful when some
values for a computation are incertain.

this octave add-on package is part of the octave-forge project.
