Python bindings for libncap
	
ncap is a network capture library like libpcap (on which it is based)
and tcpdump. it produces binary data in its own ncap format, which can
be stored in a dump file or transmitted over a udp socket. unlike
libpcap, it discards data link headers and only supports ipv4 and ipv6
packets, but it can perform reassembly of ip datagrams.

this package contains the python bindings.
