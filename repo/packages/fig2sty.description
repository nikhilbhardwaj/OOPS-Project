Latex layout generator based on xfig
	
fig2sty allows you to generate fancy layouts with latex.  the basic idea
is to draw layout definitions interactively with xfig and transform this
definition to a latex style file. you can then use latex to typeset your
text into arbitrarily shaped polygons (frames) within the layout.

this package also provides a perl module (xfig.pm) to parse xfig files.
