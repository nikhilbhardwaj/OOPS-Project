Automatic printer filter
	
magicfilter is a customizable, extensible automatic printer filter.

it translates the files that you send to a printer to a "language" that
your printer can "understand". to accomplish this goal, it determines
the type of the file that is to be printed and uses its "knowledge" to
convert the file to something that is printable.

this is done by use of magicfilter's own magic database (a la file(1))
to decide how to print out a given print job.
