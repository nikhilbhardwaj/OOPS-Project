Perl module to remove files or directories
	
file::remove::remove removes files and directories.  it acts like
/bin/rm, for the most part.  although unlink can be given a list
of files, it will not remove directories; this module remedies that.
it also accepts wildcards, * and ?, as arguments for filenames.
