Synchronisation agent for gpe pim data
	
gpesyncd synchronises pim data by transforming vcards, vevents, vttodo and
icals to the appropriate format in the sqlite database of the respective gpe
applications and vice versa.

gpesyncd exports and imports pim data either to stdout or over tcp/ip.
it can also be used as a command line tool to access all the pim data.

opensync-plugin-gpe needs gpesyncd to run on the machine where the gpe
application data are stored.
