Combined cd player + mixer designed for windowmaker
	
this dockapp combines a cd player and a mixer in one 48x48 window.
very efficient on screen real-estate.  especially handy if you mainly
want a mixer, and only rarely use a cd player, but want to have one
around just in case.

it's designed with windowmaker in mind, but it works fine with any
window manager, and can be swallowed by afterstep/fvwm/gnome panel/etc.
