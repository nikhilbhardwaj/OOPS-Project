Filter that inserts printer specific commands into print jobs
	
ppdfilt is a filter program designed to be used within a filter
script or from the command line tool to insert printer specific
commands to a postscript print job. this can be used to tell the printer
to duplex or staple the print job, or tell it what paper tray to draw
paper from. in the gnulpr printing environment, users do not call ppdfilt
directly, but its features are accessed by using 'lpr' or 'gpr' (see)
