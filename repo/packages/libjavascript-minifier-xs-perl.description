Xs based javascript minifier
	
javascript::minifier::xs is a javascript "minifier"; its designed to remove
un-necessary whitespace and comments from javascript files, while also not
breaking the javascript.

javascript::minifier::xs is similar in function to javascript::minifier, but
is substantially faster as its written in xs and not just pure perl.
