Decoding library for dts coherent acoustics streams (development)
	
libdca provides a low-level interface to decode audio frames encoded using
dts coherent acoustics. dts coherent acoustics streams are commonly found
on dvds, dts audio cds and some radio broadcastings. libdca also provides
downmixing and dynamic range compression for various output configurations.

this package contains the headers and static libraries used to build
applications that use libdca.
