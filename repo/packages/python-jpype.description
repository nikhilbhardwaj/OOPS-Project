Binding the worlds of java and python
	
jpype is an effort to allow python programs full access to java class
libraries. this is achieved not through re-implementing python, as
jython/jpython has done, but rather through interfacing at the native
level in both virtual machines.

eventually, it should be possible to replace java with python in many,
though not all, situations. jsp, servlets, rmi servers and ide plugins
are good candidates.
