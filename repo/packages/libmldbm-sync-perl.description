Perl module for safe concurrent access to mldbm databases
	
mldbm::sync wraps around the mldbm interface, by handling concurrent
access to mldbm databases with file locking, and flushes i/o explicity
per lock/unlock.  the new [read]lock()/unlock() api can be used to serialize
requests logically and improve performance for bundled reads & writes.
