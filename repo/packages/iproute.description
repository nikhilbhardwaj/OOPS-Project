Networking and traffic control tools
	
the iproute suite, also known as iproute2, is a collection of
utilities for networking and traffic control.

these tools communicate with the linux kernel via the (rt)netlink
interface, providing advanced features not available through the
legacy net-tools commands 'ifconfig' and 'route'.
