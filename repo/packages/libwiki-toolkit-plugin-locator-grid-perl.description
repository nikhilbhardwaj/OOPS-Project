A wiki::toolkit plugin to manage co-ordinate data
	
access to and calculations using co-ordinate metadata supplied to a
wiki::toolkit wiki when writing a node.

note: this is read-only access. if you want to write to a node's
metadata, you need to do it using the write_node method of
wiki::toolkit.

we assume that the points are located on a flat, square grid with unit
squares of side 1 metre.
