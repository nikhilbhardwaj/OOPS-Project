C++ library of genetic algorithm components
	
galib contains a set of c++ genetic algorithm objects. the library
includes tools for using genetic algorithms to do optimization in any c++
program using any representation and genetic operators. the documentation
includes an extensive overview of how to implement a genetic algorithm as
well as examples illustrating customizations to the galib classes.
