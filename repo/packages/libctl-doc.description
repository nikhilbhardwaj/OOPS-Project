Library for flexible control files, documentation
	
libctl is a free guile-based library implementing flexible control files for
scientific simulations. it was written to support the mit photonic-bands
program, but will hopefully prove useful in other programs too.

this package contains the documentation in html format and a simple example of
how to use it.
