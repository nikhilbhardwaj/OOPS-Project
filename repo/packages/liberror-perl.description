Perl module for error/exception handling in an oo-ish way
	
this module provides two interfaces.  firstly "error" provides a
procedural interface to exception handling.  secondly "error" is a
base class for errors/exceptions that can either be thrown, for
subsequent catch, or can simply be recorded.

errors in the class "error" should not be thrown directly, but the
user should throw errors from a sub-class of "error".
