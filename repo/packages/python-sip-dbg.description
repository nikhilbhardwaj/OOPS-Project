Python/c++ bindings generator runtime library (debug extension)
	
sip is a tool for generating bindings for c++ classes with some ideas
borrowed from swig, but capable of tighter bindings because of its
specificity towards c++ and python.

this package contains the extension built for the python debug interpreter.
