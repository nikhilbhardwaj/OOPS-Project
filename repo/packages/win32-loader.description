Debian-installer loader for win32
	
this package provides a win32 program that can be used as a loader for
debian installer, acting as a more user-friendly boot mechanism than
traditional bios-based boot.

this package contains both the cdrom/usb-disk add-on that starts a media-based
install and the standalone netboot loader.
