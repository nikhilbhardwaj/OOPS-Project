A "paranoid" subclass of lwp::useragent
	
the lwpx::paranoidagent is a class subclassing lwp::useragent, but
paranoid against attackers. it's to be used when a remote resource is
fetched on behalf of a possibly malicious user.

this class can do whatever lwp::useragent can (callbacks, uploads
from files, etc).

proxy support has been removed, because in that case you should do
your paranoia at your proxy.

the uri scheme are limited to http and https.
