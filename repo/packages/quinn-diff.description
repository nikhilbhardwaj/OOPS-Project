Compares a packages file and a sources file
	
this is a program to compare a packages file and a sources file
to see which programs need (re)compiling for any given architecture.

quinn diff can be told about architecture specific packages (e.g. lilo) and
can easily exclude them via a packages-arch-specific file.  the
output is a list of source packages complete with accurate section
and version information, suitable for use in build daemons or just in
a script to auto-snarf the necessary source.
