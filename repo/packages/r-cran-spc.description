evaluation of control charts by means of the zero-state, steady-state arl
(average run length). setting up control charts for given in-control arl
and plotting of the related figures. the control charts under consideration
are one- and two-sided ewma and cusum charts for monitoring the mean of
normally distributed independent data. now, the arl calculation of
ewma-s^2 control charts is added. other charts and parameters are in
