Pure ruby library for generating charts in svg format (documentation)
	
svg::graph allows to generate charts, that is, graphs where the values of one
axis are not scalar. it has a very similar api to the perl library
svg::tt::graph, and the resulting charts also look the same. this isn't
surprising, because svg::graph started as a loose port of svg::tt::graph,
although the internal code no longer resembles the perl original at all.

this package contains the documentation.
