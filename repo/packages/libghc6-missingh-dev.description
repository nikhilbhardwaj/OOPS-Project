Library of utility functions for haskell, ghc6 package
	
missingh is a library of all sorts of utility functions for
haskell programmers.  it is written in pure haskell and thus should
be extremely portable and easy to use.  it also has no prerequisites
save those that are commonly included with haskell compilers.

missingh is based on missinglib library for ocaml and contains some
of the same features.  however, some features are left behind because
they are already in haskell or not needed here -- and others are added
due to things haskell is missing, or things that haskell makes
possible.
