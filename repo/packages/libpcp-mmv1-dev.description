Performance co-pilot memory mapped value library and headers
	
the libpcp-mmv-dev package contains the performance co-pilot (pcp)
library and header files needed to utilise memory mapped value
instrumentation into a monitored application.

the performance co-pilot provides a unifying abstraction for
all of the interesting performance data in a system, and allows
client applications to easily retrieve and process any subset of
that data.
