Perl smtp client library supporting tls and auth
	
net::smtp::tls is a tls and auth capable smtp client library which offers an
interface that users will find familiar from net::smtp. net::smtp::tls
implements a subset of the methods provided by that module, but certainly not
(yet) a complete mirror image of that api.
