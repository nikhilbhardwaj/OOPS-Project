Perl pragma to establish inheritance at compile time
	
parent is a perl pragma to establish an isa relationship with base classes
at compile time. this module allows you to both load one or more modules,
while setting up inheritance from those modules at the same time. this module
was forked from the standard 'base' pragma.
