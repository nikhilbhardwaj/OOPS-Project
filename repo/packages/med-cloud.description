Debian med bioinformatics applications usable in cloud computing
	
this metapackage will install debian packages related to molecular biology,
structural biology and bioinformatics for use in life sciences, that do not
depend on graphical toolkits and therefore can fit on system images for use
in cloud computing clusters, where space can be limited.
