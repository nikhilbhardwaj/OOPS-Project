The s-lang programming library - runtime version
	
s-lang is a c programmer's library that includes routines for the rapid
development of sophisticated, user friendly, multi-platform applications.

this package contains only the shared library libslang.so.* and copyright
information. it is only necessary for programs that use this library (such
as jed and slrn). if you plan on doing development with s-lang, you will
need the companion -dev package as well.
