Generator of textures through interactive evolution
	
this is an interactive generative art application to evolve
images/textures/patterns/animations through an iterative process of random
mutation and user-selection driven evolution. this process is also often
referred to as "evolutionary art" or "genetic art". if you like lava lamps,
and still think the mandelbrot set is cool, this could be the software for
you.
