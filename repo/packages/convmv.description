Filename encoding conversion tool
	
convmv can convert a single filename, a directory tree or all files
on a filesystem to a different encoding. it only converts the
encoding of filenames, not files contents. a special feature of
convmv is that it also takes care of symlinks: the encoding of the
symlink's target will be converted if the symlink itself is being
converted.

it is also possible to convert directories to utf-8 which are already
partially utf-8 encoded.
