Putty terminal emulator
	
this is an x terminal emulator based on the popular windows ssh client,
putty. it supports xterm escape sequences, plus some linux console
sequences for colour palette configuration and some decterm sequences for
title bar control, and with an appropriate font it supports the utf-8
encoding of unicode. it also has some nifty features like rectangular
selection and nethack keypad mode.
