Ruby implementation of the git revision control system
	
libgit-ruby allows ruby applications to access and manipulate git
repositories.  it provides an object-oriented interface to gitâ€™s data storage
system and is capable of reading from and writing to the index, managing
branches, or obtaining information about the history of a project.

git is a popular distributed source code management tool.  the original
implementation can be found in the git-core package.
