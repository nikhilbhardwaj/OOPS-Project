Module to access ipc shared memory segments through perl
	
this perl module provides a tie() interface to system v ipc shared memory
segments.

ipc::shareable allows you to tie a variable to shared memory making it
easy to share the contents of that variable with other perl processes.
scalars, arrays, and hashes can be tied.  the variable being tied may
contain arbitrarily complex data structures - including references to
arrays, hashes of hashes, etc.
