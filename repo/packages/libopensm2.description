Infiniband subnet manager libraries
	
opensm provides an implementation of an infiniband subnet manager (sm) and
administrator (sa). one subnet manager is required to run on each infiniband
subnet in order to initialize the infiniband hardware.

this package contains shared libraries that are part of the opensm package
but are also used by other applications.
