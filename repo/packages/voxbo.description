Processing, statistical analysis, and display of brain imaging data
	
this is a toolkit for analysis of functional neuroimaging (chiefly
fmri) experiments and voxel-based lesion-behavior mapping. voxbo
supports the modified glm (for autocorrelated data), as well as the
standard glm for non-autocorrelated data. the toolkit is designed to be
interoperable with afni, fsl, spm and others.
