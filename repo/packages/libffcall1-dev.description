Foreign function call libraries (development files)
	
this is a collection of four libraries which can be used to build
foreign function call interfaces in embedded interpreters.

the four packages are:


   avcall - calling c functions with variable arguments



   vacall - c functions accepting variable argument prototypes



   trampoline - closures as first-class c functions



   callback - closures with variable arguments as first-class c functions
              (a reentrant combination of vacall and trampoline)
