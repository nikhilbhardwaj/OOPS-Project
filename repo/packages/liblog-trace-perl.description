Perl module to provide a unified approach to tracing
	
a module to provide a unified approach to tracing. a script can use log::trace
qw( < mode > ) to set the behaviour of the trace function.

by default, the trace functions are exported to the calling package only. you
can export the trace functions to other packages with the "deep" option. see
"options" for more information.

all exports are in uppercase (to minimise collisions with "real" functions).
