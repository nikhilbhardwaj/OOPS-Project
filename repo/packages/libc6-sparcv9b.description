Embedded gnu c library: shared libraries [v9b optimized]
	
contains the standard libraries that are used by nearly all programs on
the system. this package includes shared versions of the standard c
library and the standard math library, as well as many others.

this set of libraries is optimized for the ultrasparc v9b abi. it only
needs to be installed on ultrasparc machines. if you install this on a
non-ultrasparc, it won't even be used.
