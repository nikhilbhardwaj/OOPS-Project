Tao cli binding for freeglut - development files
	
the tao framework is a collection of bindings and libraries to
facilitate cross-platform games-related development utilizing the mono
and .net platforms.

freeglut is a completely opensourced alternative to the opengl utility
toolkit (glut) library. glut (and hence freeglut) allows the user to
create and manage windows containing opengl contexts on a wide range of
platforms and also read the mouse, keyboard and joystick functions.

this package contains development files for tao.freeglut, and should be
used for compilation.
