Ip defragmentation tcp segment reassembly library (development)
	
libnids is a library that provides the functionality of one of the nids
(network intrusion detection system) components, namely e-component.
libnids code watches all local network traffic, cooks received datagrams a
bit, and provides convenient information about them to the nids analyzing
modules.
libnids performs assembly of tcp segments into tcp streams, ip
defragmentation, and tcp port scan detection.
