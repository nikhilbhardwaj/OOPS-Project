Speed up perl scripts by making them persistent
	
speedycgi is a way to run perl scripts persistently, which usually makes
them run much more quickly because it avoids the overhead of starting
up a new perl interpreter and compiling the perl code.  it is also known
as persistentperl: while its most common use is with cgi scripts, it can
be used to speed up most perl programs.
