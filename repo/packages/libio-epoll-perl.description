Perl interface to the epoll io multiplexing subsystem
	
io::epoll provides access to the new, (currently) linux-specific variant of
poll() known as epoll(). it is designed to offer o(1) scalability over large
numbers of watched file descriptors.

this module provides a higher-level layer designed to emulate the behaviour
of io::poll and io::ppoll, but also exposes the corresponding low-level api
that closely matches the related system calls.
