Xmms2 - daap plug-in
	
xmms2 is a redesign of the xmms music player. it features a client-server
model, allowing multiple (even simultaneous!) user interfaces, both textual
and graphical. all common audio formats are supported using plug-ins. on top of
this, there is a flexible media library to organize your music.

this package contains a plug-in which allows you to share your media
library over their network via daap (digital audio access protocol).
