Pkcs#11 wrapper for python
	
pykcs11 let you access to almost all pkcs#11 functions and data types using
any pkcs#11 library, such as the various modules supplied by smartcard
vendors.

the wrapper comes with 2 interfaces: a low level and very thin interface over
the original pkcs#11 api, generated using the swig compiler (designed for
library tests); and an high level interface that offers a simpler access (with
few limits) to the pkcs#11 apis.
