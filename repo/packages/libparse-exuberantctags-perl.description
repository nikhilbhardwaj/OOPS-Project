Exuberant ctags parser for perl
	
parse::exuberantctags parses ctags files and handles both traditional
ctags as well as extended ctags files such as produced with exuberant
ctags. it does not handle emacs-style "etags" files.

the module is implemented as a wrapper around the readtags library
that normally ships with exuberant ctags. if you do not know what
that is, you are encouraged to have a look at
http://ctags.sourceforge.net/ and look at the exuberant-ctags
package.
