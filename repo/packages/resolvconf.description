Name server information handler
	
resolvconf is a framework for keeping up to date the system's
information about name servers. it sets itself up as the intermediary
between programs that supply this information (such as ifup and
ifdown, dhcp clients, the ppp daemon and local name servers) and
programs that use this information (such as dns caches and resolver
libraries).

this package may require some manual configuration. please
read the readme file for detailed instructions.
