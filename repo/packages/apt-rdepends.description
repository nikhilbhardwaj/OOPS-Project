Recursively lists package dependencies
	
this utility can recursively list package dependencies, either forwards
or in reverse.  it also lists forward build-dependencies.  the output
format closely resembles that of `apt-cache depends`.  as well, it can
generate .dot graphs, much like apt-cache in dotty mode.
