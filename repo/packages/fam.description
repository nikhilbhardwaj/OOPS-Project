File alteration monitor
	
fam monitors files and directories, notifying interested applications
of changes.

this package provides a server that can monitor a given list of files
and notify applications through a socket.  if the kernel supports
dnotify (kernels >= 2.4.x) fam is notified directly by the kernel.
otherwise it has to poll the files' status.  fam can also provide an
rpc service for monitoring remote files (such as on a mounted nfs
filesystem).
