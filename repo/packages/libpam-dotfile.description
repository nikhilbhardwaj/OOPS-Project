A pam module which allows users to have more than one password
	
pam_dotfile is a pam module which allows users to have more than one
password for a single account, each for a different service. this
makes sense since many users have objections to use the same password
for (as an example) the imap4 mailbox and the ssh access. the imap4
password should be distinct from the ssh password since the user wants
to save the former in the configuration of his mail agent, but not the
latter. the same applies to pop3 mailboxes, ftp and comparable services.
