Convert ascii diagrams into proper bitmap graphics
	
ditaa is a small command-line utility that can convert diagrams drawn using
ascii art ("drawings" that contain characters that resemble lines, like | /
and -), into proper bitmap graphics.

ditaa also uses special markup syntax to increase the possibilities of shapes
and symbols that can be rendered.
