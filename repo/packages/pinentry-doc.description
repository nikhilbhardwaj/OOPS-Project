Documentation for pinentry packages
	
this package contains the documentation for the pinentry packages,
a suite of programs that allow secure entry of pins or pass phrases.
if you have one of the pinentry packages installed then you may want
to install this package as well, but the documentation mostly concerns
the internal protocol and is therefore not necessary for the casual
user.
