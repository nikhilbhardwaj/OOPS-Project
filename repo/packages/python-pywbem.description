Python wbem client and provider interface
	
pywbem is a python library that implements a web based enterprise
management (wbem) client.  it performs wbem operations using the
cim-xml and cim operations over http protocols as defined by the
distributed management task force (dmtf).  wbem is used to remotely
describe and manage distributed computing environments.  it is a peer
and perhaps successor to the snmp protocol.
