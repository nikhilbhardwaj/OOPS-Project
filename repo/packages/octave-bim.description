Pde solver using a finite element/volume approach in octave
	
this package contains scripts for solving diffusion advection
reaction (dar) partial differential equations based on the finite
volume scharfetter-gummel (fvsg) method a.k.a box integration method
(bim) in octave, a scientific computation software.

this octave add-on package is part of the octave-forge project.
