Perl module to check if makefile.pl has the right pre-requisites
	
test::prerq examines the modules looking on blib/lib/,
blib/script, and the test files t/*  (and test.pl).
then figures out which modules they use, skips the modules that are
in the perl core, and compares the remaining list of modules to those
in the prereq_pm section of makefile.pl.
