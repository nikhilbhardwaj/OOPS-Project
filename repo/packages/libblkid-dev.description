Block device id library - headers and static libraries
	
the blkid library which allows system programs like fsck and
mount to quickly and easily find block devices by filesystem uuid and
label.  this allows system administrators to avoid specifiying
filesystems by hard-coded device names, but via a logical naming
system instead.

this package contains the development environment for the blkid library.
