Xmms2 - phone home package
	
xmms2 is a redesign of the xmms music player. it features a client-server
model, allowing multiple (even simultaneous!) user interfaces, both textual
and graphical. all common audio formats are supported using plug-ins. on top of
this, there is a flexible media library to organize your music.

this package contains a small program that (anonymously) reports back
information on your computer and xmms2 configuration to the xmms2 developers.
