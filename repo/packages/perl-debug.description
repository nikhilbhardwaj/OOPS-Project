Debug-enabled perl interpreter
	
debugperl provides a debug-enabled version of perl which can produce
extensive information about the interpreter as it compiles and executes
a program (see the -d switch in perlrun(1)).

note that this package is primarily of use in debugging *perl* rather
than perl programs, which may be traced/debugged using the standard
perl binary using the -d switch (see perldebug(1)).
