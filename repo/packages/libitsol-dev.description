Iterative solvers - devel
	
itsol is a library of iterative solvers for general sparse linear systems of
equations. itsol can be viewed as an extension of the itsol module in sparskit.
it is written in c and offers a selection of recently developed
preconditioners. the preconditioner suite includes:


  * iluk (ilu preconditioner with level of fill)
  * ilut (ilu preconditioner with threshold)
  * iluc (crout version of ilut)
  * vbiluk (variable block preconditioner with level of fill - with automatic
    block detection)
  * vbilut (variable block preconditioner with threshold - with automatic
    block detection)
  * arms (algebraic recursive multilevel solvers -- includes actually several
    methods - in particular the standard arms and the ddpq version which uses
    nonsymmetric permutations)


note that itsol is a scalar package. you may find parallel implentations of
some of the preconditioners listed above in parms.

this package provides the itsol header files required to compile c/c++ programs
that use itsol.
