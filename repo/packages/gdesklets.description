Architecture for desktop applets
	
gdesklets is an architecture for "desklets", which are tiny applets
sitting on your desktop in a symbiotic relationship of eye candy and
usefulness.

you can populate your desktop with status meters, icon bars,
weather sensors, news tickers... whatever you can imagine...
virtually anything is possible and may even be available some day.

this package includes a small number of applets.
for more applets, install the gdesklets-data package.
