Simple greedy multiple alignment of non-coding dna sequences
	
sigma (“simple greedy multiple alignment”) is an alignment program with a
new algorithm and scoring scheme designed specifically for non-coding dna
sequence. it uses a strategy of seeking the best possible gapless local
alignments, at each step making the best possible alignment consistent with
existing alignments, and scores the significance of the alignment based on
the lengths of the aligned fragments and a background model which may be
supplied or estimated from an auxiliary file of intergenic dna.
