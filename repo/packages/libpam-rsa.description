Pam module for local authentication with rsa keypairs
	
the pam_rsa pam-module (also known as "poor man's smartcard") is for
local pam-authentication with rsa keypairs. it cannot be used for
authenticating to pam-services on  remote hosts. the basic idea is
that rsa private keys are stored on removable and easily portable
medias like usb memory sticks. this package provides the pam-rsa.so
module for pam.
