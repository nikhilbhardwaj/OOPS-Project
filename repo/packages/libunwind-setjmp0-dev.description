A libunwind-based non local goto - development
	
the unwind-setjmp library offers a libunwind-based implementation of
non-local gotos. this implementation is intended to be a drop-in
replacement for the normal, system-provided routines of the same name.
the main advantage of using the unwind-setjmp library is  that  setting
up a non-local goto via one of the setjmp() routines is very fast.
