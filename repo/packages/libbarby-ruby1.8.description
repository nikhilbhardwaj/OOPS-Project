Ruby library for barcode generation
	
this is a pure-ruby library for generating various kinds of barcodes,
including all the standard 1d and 2d barcodes, and meant to be easily
extensible.

barby separates the concerns of barcode generation and graphical
representations, so not only the barcodes' format can be extended,
but also the way they are output.
