Tools to manage aufs filesystems
	
the aufs driver provides a unification file system for the linux kernel. it
allows to virtually merge the contents of several directories and/or stack
them, so that apparent file changes in the aufs end in file changes in only one
of the source directories.

this package contains utilities needed to configure aufs containers on-the-fly.
