Openssl engine for pkcs#11 modules
	
with this engine for openssl you can use openssl library
and command line tools with any pkcs#11 implementation as
backend for the crypto operations.

engine_pkcs11 was developed for smart cards, and mostly
for the opensc pkcs#11 module, but it should work fine with
any pkcs#11 implementation.

engine_pkcs11 is a spin off from opensc and replaced
libopensc-openssl.
