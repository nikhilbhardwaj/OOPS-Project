O'caml library that implements exact real arithmetic
	
this  module  implements  exact  real  arithmetic,  following  valerie
menissier-morain ph.d. thesis (http://www-calfor.lip6.fr/~vmm/).

a  real  x  is  represented  as  a function  giving,  for  any  n,  an
approximation zn/4^n of x  such that |zn/4^n - x| < 1,  where zn is an
arbitrary precision integer (of type gmp.z.t).

coercions from type int, gmp.z.t, gmp.q.t, basic operations (addition,
subtraction,  multiplication,   division,  power,  square   root)  and
transcendental  functions (sin,  cos, tan,  log, exp,  arcsin, arccos,
etc.) and a few constants (pi, e) are provided.

a small reverse-polish calculator is provided to test the library.
