General purpose cryptographic library - c++ development
	
crypto++ is library for creating c++ programs which use cryptographic
algorithms.  the library uses a pipes & filters architecture with heavy
use of templates and abstract base classes.  the cryptographic
tools include:

 * authenticated encryption schemes (gcm, ccm, eax),
 * high speed stream ciphers (panama, sosemanuk, salsa20, xsalsa20),
 * aes and candidates (rijndael, rc6, mars, twofish, serpent, cast-256),
 * other symmetric block ciphers (idea, triple-des, camellia, seed,
   rc5, blowfish, tea, xtea, skipjack, shacal-2),
 * block cipher modes of operation (ecb, cbc, cts, cfb, ofb, ctr),
 * message authentication codes (vmac, hmac, cmac, cbc-mac, dmac,
   two-track-mac),
 * hash functions (sha-1, sha-224, sha-256, sha-384, sha-512, tiger,
   whirlpool, ripemd-128, ripemd-256, ripemd-160, ripemd-320),
 * public-key cryptography (rsa, dsa, elgamal, nr, rw, luc, lucelg,
   dlies, esign),
 * padding schemes for public-key systems (pkcs#1, oaep, pss, pssr,
   emsa2, emsa5),
 * key agreement schemes (dh, mqv, lucdif, xtr-dh),
 * elliptic curve cryptography (ecdsa, ecnr, ecies, ecdh, ecmqv),
 * backwards compatibility algorithms (md2, md4, md5, panama hash, des,
   arc4, seal 3.0, wake, wake-ofb, desx, rc2, safer, 3-way, gost,
   shark, cast-128, square),
 * pseudo-random number generators,

and a whole lot more.  alternative libraries are libgcrypt and
nettle.

this package contains the header files needed for developing using
the crypto++ class library.  it also includes the static library with
libtool supoport, a utility for benchmarking and using the various
crypto++ routines, and finally it includes the test vectors for
validating both the crypto++ implementation and other implementations
of these routines.
