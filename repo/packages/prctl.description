Process control operations
	
prctl is a tool to query and modify process behavior.  supported process
behavior is handling of unaligned memory access and handling of floating
point software assist faults.  the required syscalls are currently only
available on itanium processor family (ia64), hp pa-risc (hppa) and
alpha (>=2.6.15) kernels in debian.
