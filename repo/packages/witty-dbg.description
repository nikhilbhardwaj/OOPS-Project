C++ library for webapps [debug] (transition package)
	
wt (pronounced 'witty') is a c++ library and application server for
developing and deploying web applications. the api is widget-centric
and offers complete abstraction of any web-specific application details.

this package installs debugging files used to investigate problems with
binaries included in the wt packages.

this is a dummy transition package and can be safely removed.
