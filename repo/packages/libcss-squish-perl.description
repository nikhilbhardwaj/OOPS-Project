Module to compact many css files into one big file
	
css::squish is a perl module that takes a list of css files and concatenates
them, honouring any valid @import statements included in the files, following
the css 2.1 specification. media-specific @import statements will be honoured
by enclosing the included file in a @media rule.

future versions may include methods to compact whitespace and other parts of
the css itself, but this functionality is not yet supported.
