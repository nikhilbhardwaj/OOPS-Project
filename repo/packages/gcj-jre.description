Java runtime environment using gij/classpath
	
gij is a java bytecode interpreter, not limited to interpreting bytecode.
it includes a class loader which can dynamically load shared objects, so
it is possible to give it the name of a class which has been compiled and
put into a shared library on the class path.

the package contains as well a collection of wrapper scripts and symlinks.
it is meant to provide a java-rte-like interface to the gij/gcj tool set.
