Secure file deletion
	
recovery of supposedly erased data from magnetic media is easier than what many
people would like to believe. a technique called magnetic force microscopy
(mfm) allows any moderately funded opponent to recover the last two or three
layers of data written to disk. wipe repeatedly writes special patterns to the
files to be destroyed, using the fsync() call and/or the o_sync bit to force
disk access.
