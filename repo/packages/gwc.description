Audio file denoiser
	
the gnome wave cleaner (gwc) is an application that helps you in
getting rid of noise and clicks in audio files. this is most
commonly used when translating your old vinyl or old tapes to
a digital format, but it can be applied to every soundfile that
has a more or less constant noise level.
