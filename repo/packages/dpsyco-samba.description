Automate administration of access to samba
	
this package contains a tool to automatically give some
users or hosts access to a samba server. it is not that
easy to administrate yet, but that should change soon.

warning! samba users with uid between 500 and 999 will be automatically
administrated by this tool. this means that if you do not have a admin
package that set up users correctly, these users will be removed and
the user will not be able to log in again. you have been warned!
