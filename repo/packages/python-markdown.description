markdown is a text-to-html conversion tool for web writers. markdown
allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text
format, then convert it to structurally valid xhtml (or html).

this is a python implementation of john gruber's markdown. the current
version of python-markdown implements all markdown syntax features and
fully passes markdown test suite 1.0. it also supports footnotes and
attributes.
