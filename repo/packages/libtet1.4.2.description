A quality tetrahedral mesh generator
	
tetgen generates the delaunay tetrahedralization, voronoi diagram, and convex
hull for three-dimensional point sets, generates the constrained delaunay
tetrahedralizations and quality tetrahedral meshes for three-dimensional
domains with piecewise linear boundary.

this package provides the runtime shared library.
