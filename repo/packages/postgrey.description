Greylisting implementation for postfix
	
this package provides a policy server for postfix to implement "greylisting".

greylisting is a spam filtering method that rejects email from external
servers on the first try. spammers don't usually retry sending their
messages, whereas legitimate mail servers do.

while postgrey is designed for use with postfix, it can also be used
with exim.
