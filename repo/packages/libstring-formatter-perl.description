Module to build sprintf-like formatting routines
	
string::formatter is a tool for building sprintf-like formatting routines. it
supports named or positional formatting, custom conversions, fixed string
interpolation, and simple width-matching out of the box. it is easy to alter
its behavior to write new kinds of format string expanders. for most cases,
it should be easy to build all sorts of formatters out of the options built
into string::formatter.
