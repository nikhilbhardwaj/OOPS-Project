A lightweight, non-caching, optionally anonymizing http proxy
	
an anonymizing http proxy which is very light on system resources,
ideal for smaller networks and similar situations where other proxies
(such as squid) may be overkill and/or a security risk. tinyproxy can
also be configured to anonymize http requests (allowing for exceptions
on a per-header basis).
