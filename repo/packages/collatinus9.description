Lemmatisation of latin text
	
collatinus can be used to lemmatise latin texts, i.e. extract words and
make a lexicon which indicates for each word its canonic form, and how
the form actually found in the text was derived from it, for instance by
declining it. example : rosam gives : rosa-rosae -- acc. sing.
collatinus provides a nice graphic front-end to each operation.
