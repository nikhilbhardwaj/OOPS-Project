Job server and scheduler for moving long-running tasks into the background
	
backgroundrb is a ruby job server and scheduler. its main intent is to
be used with ruby on rails applications for offloading long-running
tasks.

since a rails application blocks while serving a request it is best to
move long-running tasks off into a background process that is
divorced from http request/response cycle.

this package is part of the ruby library extras, a supplement to ruby's
standard library.
