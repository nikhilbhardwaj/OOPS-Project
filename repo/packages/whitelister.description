A postfix whitelister daemon
	
whitelister is a postfix whitelister policy daemon aimed to whitelist mails
that come from clean hosts wrt rbl/rhbl in order to let suspicious mails go
through evil treatments like greylisting.

whitelister has also spf capabilities, and can even (despite its name) reject
mails based on spf (see http://spf.pobox.com/ for more informations).
