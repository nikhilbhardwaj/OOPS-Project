Ldap bindings for ocaml
	
it supports the core ldap-client functions, including search, add,
modify, and delete.

it has now an object oriented interface which supports the above
features, and some additional ones. such as, nice data structures
for local ldap entries which record local modifications and can sync
them with the server, fewer arguments needed to perform simple
tasks, and an api modeled after perl's net::ldap.
