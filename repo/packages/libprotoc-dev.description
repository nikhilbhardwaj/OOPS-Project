Protocol buffers compiler library (development files)
	
protocol buffers are a flexible, efficient, automated mechanism for
serializing structured data - similar to xml, but smaller, faster, and
simpler. you define how you want your data to be structured once, then you can
use special generated source code to easily write and read your structured
data to and from a variety of data streams and using a variety of languages.
you can even update your data structure without breaking deployed programs
that are compiled against the "old" format.

google uses protocol buffers for almost all of its internal rpc protocols and
file formats.

this package contains the development headers and static library needed for
writing protobuf compilers.
