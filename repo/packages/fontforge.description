Font editor
	
besides being a font editor, fontforge is also a font format
converter, and can convert among postscript (ascii & binary type 1,
some type 3s, some type 0s), truetype, and opentype (type2),
cid-keyed, svg, cff and multiple-master fonts.

this package also provides these programs and utilities:

 fontimage - produce a font thumbnail image;
 fontlint  - checks the font for certain common errors;
 sfddiff   - compare two font files.
