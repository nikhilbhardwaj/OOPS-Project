Charting add-on for nagios
	
the "netways nagios grapher" is a graphing system which uses templates to
assign services to various data sources (rrds). thus it is possible to
create a quantity of graphs using only a small configuration, keeping it
easy to manage. these templates are automatically applied to incoming
data, thus creating a new service in nagios will automatically create the
graph once valid data is seen for that service. correlations between
different graphs is also possible.
