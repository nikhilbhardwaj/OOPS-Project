Perl interface to the unix syslog(3) calls
	
this module provides an interface to the system logger syslogd(8) via
perl's xsubs. the implementation attempts to resemble the native
libc-functions of your system, so that anyone being familiar with
syslog.h should be able to use this module right away.
