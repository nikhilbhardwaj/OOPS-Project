Parsing and manipulation of structured config files(c++ development)
	
this library features a fully reentrant parser and includes bindings for
both the c and c++ programming languages. it runs on modern posix-compliant
systems such as linux, solaris, and mac os x (darwin), as well as on
microsoft windows 2000/xp and later (visual studio or mingw).

this library allows parsing, manipulating and writing structured configuration
files. its main features are:

 - a fully reentrant parser: multiple configurations can be parsed in
   concurrent threads at the same time.
 - a simple, structured configuration file format: more readable and compact
   than xml and more flexible than windows' "ini" file format.
 - a low-footprint implementation
 - proper documentation.


this package contains the files needed in order to use libconfig
in your own c++ programs.
