Provides functions to remove accents using utf16 as a pivot
	
text::unaccent is a module that provides functions to remove accents
from a string.  for instance the string été will become ete.  the
charset of the input string is specified as an argument. the input is
converted to utf-16 using iconv(3), accents are stripped and the
result is converted back to the original charset. the iconv -l
command on gnu/linux will show all charset supported.
