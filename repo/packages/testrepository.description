Test result manager
	
testrepository provides a database of test results and supports easy workflows
to be built on top of that database. for instance, running just failing tests
or getting the last test run back to examine again (without running the tests
again). testrepository is compatible with any test suite that can output
subunit. this includes any tap test suite and any pyunit compatible test
suite.

the testrepository package contains the cli front end.
