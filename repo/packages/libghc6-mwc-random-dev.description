Fast, high quality pseudo random number generation
	
this package provides a library for the haskell programming language.
see http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on haskell.

this package contains code for generating high quality random numbers that
follow either a uniform or normal distribution. the generated numbers are
suitable for use in statistical applications.

the uniform prng uses marsaglia's mwc256 (also known as mwc8222)
multiply-with-carry generator, which has a period of 2^8222 and fares well in
tests of randomness. it is also extremely fast, between 2 and 3 times faster
than the mersenne twister.

compared to the mersenne-random package, this package has a more convenient
api, is faster, and supports more statistical distributions.
