Icarus verilog compiler (transitional package)
	
icarus verilog is intended to compile all of the verilog hdl as
described in the ieee-1364 standard. it is not quite there
yet. it does currently handle a mix of structural and behavioral
constructs.

the compiler can target either simulation, or netlist (edif).

this is a dummy transitional package that will ensure a proper upgrade path.
this package may be safely removed after upgrading.
