Perl module that provides automatic signature testing
	
"module::signature" allows you to verify that a distribution has not
been tampered with. "test::signature" lets that be tested as part of the
distribution's test suite.

important: this is not a substitute for the users verifying the
distribution themselves. by the time this module is run, the users will
have already run your makefile.pl or build.pl scripts which could have
been compromised.
