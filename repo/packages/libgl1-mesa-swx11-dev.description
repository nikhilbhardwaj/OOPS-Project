A free implementation of the opengl api -- development files
	
this package provides the development environment required for
compiling programs with mesa.  for a complete description of mesa,
please look at the libgl1-mesa-swx11 package.

this library provides a pure software rasteriser; it does not provide
a direct rendering-capable library, or one which uses glx.  for that,
please see libgl1-mesa-dev.
