Manage a case preserving but case insensitive hash table
	
tie::cphash provides a hash table that is case preserving but case
insensitive. this means that


 $cphash{key}    $cphash{key}
 $cphash{key}    $cphash{key}


all refer to the same entry.  also, the hash remembers which form of
the key was last used to store the entry.  the keys and each functions
will return the key that was used to set the value.
