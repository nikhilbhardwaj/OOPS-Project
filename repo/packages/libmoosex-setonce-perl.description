Module providing write-once, read-many attributes for moose
	
moosex::setonce provides the setonce attribute which lets your class have
attributes that are not lazy and not set, but that cannot be altered once
set.

the logic is very simple: if you try to alter the value of an attribute with
the setonce trait, either by accessor or writer, and the attribute has a
value, it will throw an exception.

if the attribute has a clearer, you may clear the attribute and set it again.
