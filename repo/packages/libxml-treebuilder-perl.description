Xml parser providing xml::elements dom similar to html::element
	
xml::treebuilder uses xml::parser to make xml document trees constructed of
xml::element objects (and xml::element is a subclass of html::element adapted
for xml).

xml::treebuilder is meant particularly for people who are used to
the html::treebuilder / html::element interface to document trees, and who
don't want to learn some other document interface like xml::twig or xml::dom.
