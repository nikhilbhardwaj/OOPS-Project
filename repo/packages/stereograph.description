Stereogram generator
	
stereograph is a stereogram generator. in detail it is a single image
stereogram (sis) generator. that is a program that produces two-dimensional
images that seem to be three-dimensional (surely you know the famous works of
"the magic eye", stereograph produces the same output). you do _not_ need
any pair of colored spectacles to regard them - everyone can learn it.
