Performance co-pilot library and headers
	
the libpcp-dev package contains the base performance co-pilot (pcp)
library and header files needed to develop collector and monitor
programs which make use of pcp services.

the performance co-pilot provides a unifying abstraction for
all of the interesting performance data in a system, and allows
client applications to easily retrieve and process any subset of
that data.
