Tool to integrate c/c++ code with lua - development files
	
tolua is a tool that greatly simplifies the integration of c/c++ code with
lua. based on a cleaned header file, tolua automatically generates the
binding code to access c/c++ features from lua. using lua api and tag
method facilities, tolua maps c/c++ constants, external variables,
functions, classes, and methods to lua.
