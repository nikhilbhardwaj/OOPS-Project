Adventure and role-playing game (engine)
	
dink smallwood is an adventure/role-playing game, similar to zelda,
made by rtsoft. besides twisted humour, it includes the actual game
editor, allowing players to create hundreds of new adventures called
dink modules or d-mods for short.

gnu freedink is a new and portable version of the game engine, which
runs the original game as well as its d-mods, with close
compatibility, under multiple platforms.

this package contains the game engine alone.
