Multi-algorithm compression
	
dact compresses each block within the file with all its known algorithms and
uses the block with the best compression ratio.

dact can encrypt the compressed data with one of two algorithms.

compression time for dact is slow as each block is compressed multiple times.

current supported compression algorithms include rle, delta, text, zlib,
modified zlib, bzip2 and seminibble encoding.
