Interactive file transfers over ssh
	
zssh (zmodem ssh) is a program for interactively transferring files to a
remote machine  while using  the secure  shell (ssh).  it is intended to
be a convenient  alternative to scp, allowing to  transfer files without
having to open another session and re-authenticate oneself.

files are transferred through the zmodem  protocol,  using the rz and sz
commands.
