Oss compatibility package
	
this package ensures that oss support is provided in some way.  on linux, it
enables the alsa compatibility modules.  on other kernels where oss is the
default interface, no action is taken.

the purpose of this package is for applications that only support oss to depend
on it, hence preventing common "/dev/dsp not found" errors that would confuse
unexperienced users.
