Perl module providing list::util functions as methods on arrays
	
the autobox pragma allows methods to be called on integers, floats, strings,
arrays, hashes, and code references in exactly the same manner as blessed
references.

autobox::list::util brings all of the functions from list::util to arrays as
methods.
