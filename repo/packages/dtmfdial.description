Dtmf tone dialer
	
dtmfdial is a dtmf (dual tone multiple frequency) tone generator. this
program generates the same tones that modern "touchtone" telephones use
to dial. it can be used to dial on any phone system supporting dtmf tones.
dtmfdial requires a sound card to work, and is designed to be used as a
phone dialer from address book programs.
