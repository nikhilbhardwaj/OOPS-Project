Jdom xpath engine
	
a xpath engine for jdom, created by the werken & sons company.

it's not overly useful by itself, but rather needs an (currently in
development) implementation of xpointer, xslt, or other xpath-based
specification.  werken.xpath is merely an engine which can parse xpaths,
and walk jdom <http://www.jdom.org/> trees.
