Documentation and examples for the opengl utility toolkit
	
glut (as in ``gluttony'') is a window system independent toolkit for
writing opengl programs.  it implements a simple windowing api, which
makes life considerably easier when learning about and exploring opengl
programming.

this package is now obsolete, and is replaced by ``freeglut3-dev''.
