Common lisp library that provides a socket level postgresql interface
	
pg is a socket-level interface to the postgresql object-relational
database. the library implements the client part of the frontend/backend
protocol, so does not require interfacing with the libpq library. sql
types are converted to the equivalent common lisp types where possible.
supports large objects (blobs).
