Apache2 filter module for html links rewriting
	
mod_proxy_html is an output filter to rewrite html links in a proxy
situation, to ensure that links work for users outside the proxy. it
serves the same purpose as apache's proxypassreverse directive does for
http headers, and is an essential component of a reverse proxy.
