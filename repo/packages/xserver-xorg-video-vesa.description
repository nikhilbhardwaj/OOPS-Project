X.org x server -- vesa display driver
	
this driver for the x.org x server (see xserver-xorg for a further description)
uses the standard vesa interface provided on all video cards, but runs
unaccelerated.  this driver is not recommended for use unless you have a
problem  with the normal driver for your card, because it will peform very
badly.
