Ocaml library for frequent string operations
	
xstr is an ocaml library for string operations.

this package implements frequent string operations: searching,
replacing, splitting, matching. it is independent from the str library,
and can replace str in many cases. unlike str, xstr is thread-safe.
xstr does not implement regular expressions in general, but an
important subset.  some operations of xstr are performed as quickly as
by str; if the string to be processed is small, xstr is often faster
than str; if the string is big, xstr is up to half as fast than str.
