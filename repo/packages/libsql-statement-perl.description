Module for parsing and processing sql statements
	
sql::statement is a perl module that implements a small, abstract sql engine.
this module is not useful itself, but as a base class for deriving concrete
sql engines. the implementation is designed to work fine with the dbi driver
dbd::csv, thus probably not so well suited for a larger environment, but i'd
hope it is extendable without too much problems.
