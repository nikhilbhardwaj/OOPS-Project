Gnu r foreach looping support
	
this package provides support for the foreach looping construct.
foreach is an idiom that allows for iterating over elements in a
collection, without the use of an explicit loop counter.  this package
in particular is intended to be used for its return value, rather
than for its side effects.  in that sense, it is similar to the
standard lapply function, but doesn't require the evaluation of
a function.  using foreach without side effects also facilitates
executing the loop in parallel.
