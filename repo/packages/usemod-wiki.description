Perl-based wiki clone
	
usemod is a reimplementation/clone of the original wiki concept
created by ward cunningham.  a "wiki" is a website that is
collaboratively edited by its users, including the ability to alter
text written by other users.

usemod provides common wiki features as well as unique features:
recent changes, conflict resolution, difference links, subpages,
interwiki links, full text searching, free links (for free-form wiki
names), administrative features.
