Compilation controller
	
the ccontrol program takes over the roles of the compiler, linker and
make, and reads a configuration file to decide what to do before
invoking them. this is particularly useful for centralized control over
commands and options, such as enabling distcc and ccache. it is also
great for controlling parallelism and which compiler versions to use,
based on the directory and make targets.
