Realtime audio frequency spectral manipulation
	
freqtweak is a tool for realtime audio spectral manipulation and
display. it provides several algorithms for processing audio data in
the frequency domain and a highly interactive gui to manipulate the
associated filters for each. it also provides high resolution
spectral displays.
