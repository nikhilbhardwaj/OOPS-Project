Perl module to find differences in files and record sets
	
text::diff provides a basic functions similar to the gnu diff utility. it is
not anywhere near as feature complete as gnu diff, but is better integrated
with perl and available on all platforms. it is often faster than shelling
out to a system's diff executable for small files, and generally slower on
larger files. while it is not guaranteed to produce the same output as the
system diff command, output is often identical.
