Configuration management program for lazy admins
	
slack tries to allow centralized configuration management with a bare
minimum of effort.  usually, just putting a file in the right place
will cause the right thing to be done.  it uses rsync to copy files
around, so can use any sort of source (nfs directory, remote server
over ssh, remote server over rsync) that rsync supports.
