Imaging library designed for afterstep - development files
	
libafterimage is the imaging library implemented for afterstep
x window manager. it has been generalized to be suitable for any
application in need of robust graphics engine.

it provides facilities for loading images from files of different
formats, compressed in memory storage of images, scaling,
tinting/shading, flipping and superimposition of arbitrary number of
images over each other. in addition it allows for linear gradients
drawing, and antialiased/smoothed text drawing using both  freetype
