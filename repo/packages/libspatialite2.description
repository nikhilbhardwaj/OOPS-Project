Geospatial extension for sqlite - libraries
	
the spatialite extension enables sqlite to support spatial (geometry) data
in a way conformant to opengis specifications, with both wkt and wkb formats.

spatialite also includes virtualshape and virtualtext to enable accessing
shapefiles and csv/text files as virtual tables.

this package contains all shared libraries used by spatialite based programs.
