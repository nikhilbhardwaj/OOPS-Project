Provide extra general functions for octave
	
this package provides additional general functions for octave, a
numerical computation software. it cointains functions to transpose
complex matrixes (ctranspose), check if a string is sorted
(issorted), take the non-conjugate transpose of a matrix (transpose)
and a function to generate a symmetric matrix from the lower
triangular elements of a vector (unvech).

this octave add-on package is part of the octave-forge project.
