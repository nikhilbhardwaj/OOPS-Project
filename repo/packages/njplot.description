A phylogenetic tree drawing program
	
njplot is able to draw any dendrogram expressed in the newick standard
phylogenetic tree format (e.g., the format used by the phylip package).
njplot is especially convenient for rooting the unrooted trees
obtained from parsimony, distance or maximum likelihood tree-building
methods.
