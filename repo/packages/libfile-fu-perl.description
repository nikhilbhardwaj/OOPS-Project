file::fu is a perl module that provides an method of manipulating directories
and files as objects, making use of operator overloading to allow for precise
composition fo paths and support for many built-in methods. it also provides
a way to create temporary directories and files.

the interface and style provided by this module are quite different than perl
built-in functions or file::spec. the syntax is concise and errors are checked
using exceptions, so you never need to check a return code.
