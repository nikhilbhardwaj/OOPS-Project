Use perl code in ocaml programs, runtime library
	
perl4caml allows you to use perl code within objective caml (ocaml),
thus neatly side-stepping the old problem with ocaml which was that it
lacked a comprehensive set of libraries. well now you can use any part
of cpan in your ocaml code.

this package provides the runtime dynamic library necessary to use this
in bytecode ocaml programs.
