Seamlessly enable svg output from scripts written using gd
	
gd::svg painlessly enables scripts that utilize gd to export scalable vector
graphics (svg). it accomplishes this task by wrapping svg.pm with gd-styled
method calls. to enable this functionality, one need only change the "use gd"
call to "use gd::svg" (and initial "new" method calls).
