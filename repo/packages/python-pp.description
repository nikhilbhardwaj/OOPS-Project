Parallel and distributed programming toolkit for python
	
parallel python module (pp) provides an easy and efficient way to
create parallel-enabled applications for smp computers and clusters.
pp module features cross-platform portability and dynamic load
balancing. thus application written with pp will parallelize
efficiently even on heterogeneous and multi-platform clusters
(including clusters running other application with variable cpu
loads).
