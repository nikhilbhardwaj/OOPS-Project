Converts documents from latex to rtf format
	
attempts to convert as much formatting information as possible from
latex to microsoft's rich text format (rtf).  while rtf has limited
support for mathematical markup, it is widely supported as a "least
common denominator" word processing format.

the detailed documentation is in the latex2rtf-doc package.
