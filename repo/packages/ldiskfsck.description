Statically-linked lustre version of the ext2 filesystem checker
	
this binary is necessary in order to check the lustre filesystem on ost and
mgs nodes. this binary is linked statically in order to do not conflict with
the regular e2fsck package, therefore it will consume much more space thant
it's dynamic linked counterpart.
