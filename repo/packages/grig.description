Graphical user interface to the ham radio control libraries
	
gnome rig is a graphical user interface to the ham radio control libraries,
which lets you control your communication radios and/or antenna rotators from
a personal computer. gnome rig is written using the gtk+ and gnome widgets.

gnome rig is in a very early stage and it supports only a very little subset
of the full hamlib api, but it can be very useful in testing basic hamlib
support for your rig.
