Prefix range module for postgresql
	
this postgresql module provides the prefix_range datatype, which
allows to index searches such as finding the longest prefix matching
a telephone number, having prefixes in a table and telephone number
as a parameter:


 select * from prefixes where prefix @> '0100091234';


the prefix column has to be of type prefix_range, and any text field
can get indexed by the provided gist opclass.
