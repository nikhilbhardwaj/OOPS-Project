Support library for ocaml preprocessor type conversions
	
the type-conv library factors out functionality needed by different
camlp4 extensions that generate code from type specifications.

camlp4 extensions adding support for some trailing "with foo" (e.g.
"with sexplib" provided by sexplib, and "with bin_io" provided by
bin-prot) after type declaration can rely on type-conv.
