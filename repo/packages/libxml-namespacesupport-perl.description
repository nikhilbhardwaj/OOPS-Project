Perl module for supporting simple generic namespaces
	
xml::namespacesupport offers a simple way to process namespace-based xml names.
it also helps maintain a prefix-to-namespace uri map, and provides a number of
basic checks.

the model for this module is sax2's namespacesupport class.  it adds a few
perl-specific changes where thought to be appropriate.
