Keyboard definition files and documentation for keytouch
	
this package contains the configuration files keytouch uses to map function
keys in different keyboard models. this package also contains the keytouch
user manual.

more keyboard configuration files are available through the program's
homepage. you can also make new ones by using keytouch-editor.

you probably don't want to install this package by itself. it's unlikely to
be of use without keytouch.
