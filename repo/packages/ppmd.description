Fast archiver program with good compression ratio
	
ppmd predicts the probability of a given character based on the
characters that immediately precede it (as all ppm compressors,
see also markov chains and context modeling). this archiver
should be better than zip, gzip, bzip2, zzip, szip and ppmz(2)
at compressing files.
