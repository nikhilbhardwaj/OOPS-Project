Small, friendly text editor inspired by pico - tiny build
	
gnu nano is an easy-to-use text editor originally designed as a replacement
for pico, the ncurses-based editor from the non-free mailer package pine
(itself now available under the apache license as alpine).

this package contains a build of gnu nano with many features disabled, for
environments such as rescue disks where resources are limited.
