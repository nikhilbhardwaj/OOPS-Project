Port of the kde style "plastik" depending on qt only
	
polymer (formerly known as plastique) is a port of the kde style
"plastik", which does not depend on any kde libraries. this means, that
you only need qt 3.x to make your qt applications look as if you had kde
installed.

currently only the multi-threaded version of the qt library is supported.
