Tools to secure bastion hosts
	
titantools provides two of the tools provided by the titan package
which are:

  * noshell: an alternative way to nologin to add shells to administrative
    (locked) system users.
  * runas: a simple generic program that allows administrators to
    start daemons as non privileged users, and optionally to run in a
    chrooted environment.
