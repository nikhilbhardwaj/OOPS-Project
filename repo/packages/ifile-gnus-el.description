A news and mail classifier for the gnus newsreader
	
ifile-gnus-el makes it possible to use the emacs gnus newsreader
together with ifile, a text classifier using the naive bayes
statistical method.  it is excellent for filtering out spam.
ifile-gnus currently works with most (all?) of the nnmail backends,
but does not work with nnimap.
