Code coverage analysis tool
	
bcov produces coverage information without recompiling a program by
instrumenting it with breakpoints. effectively it debugs the program
automatically, removing each breakpoint after it has been hit. this
produces detailed coverage information with minimal runtime overhead.

this package contains bcov for producing the coverage data and bcov-report
for generating human readable html files from the collected coverage data.
