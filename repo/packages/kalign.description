Global and progressive multiple sequence alignment
	
kalign is a command line tool to perform multiple alignment of
biological sequences. it employs the muth-manber string-matching
algorithm, to improve both the accuracy and speed of the alignment.
it uses global, progressive alignment approach, enriched by employing
an approximate string-matching algorithm to calculate sequence
distances and by incorporating local matches into the otherwise global
alignment.
