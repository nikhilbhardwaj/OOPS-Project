A library to communicate with the lttng control module - development files
	
the lttng project aims at providing highly efficient tracing tools for linux.
its tracers help tracking down performance issues and debugging problems
involving multiple concurrent processes and threads. tracing across multiple
systems is also possible.

ltt-control is the part of the lttng that allows a machine to be traced.

this package provides the header files necessary to develop applications using
liblttctl.
