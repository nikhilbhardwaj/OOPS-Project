Maintenance operations protocol loader daemon
	
this daemon services load requests on one or all ethernet interfaces using
the dec maintenance operations protocol. normally, a filename (uppercase
and ending in .sys) is included in the load request; this is looked for in
/tftpboot/mop by default and may be used as a netboot image.
