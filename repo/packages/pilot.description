Simple file browser from alpine, a text-based email client
	
"pilot" is a simple file browser from alpine.  it is used in alpine to
let the user select attachments.  as with (al)pine, commands are displayed
at the bottom of the screen, and context-sensitive help is provided.

as a stand-alone program, it is useful as a basic file browser, filling the
same utility as programs like the midnight commander.
