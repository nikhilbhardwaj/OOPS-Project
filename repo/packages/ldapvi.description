Perform an ldap search and update results using a text editor
	
from a first glance ldapvi looks like ldapsearch: you search for entries in
the ldap database. but the results get opened in your preferred editor, and
you can change, add or delete entries from there. after you are done you quit
the editor and ldapvi offers you several options: view your changes as ldif,
commit changes or discard them.
