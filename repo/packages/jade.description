James clark's dsssl engine
	
jade is an implementation of the dsssl style language.

the jade engine is a useful tool (in conjunction with a dsssl style
sheet) for translating sgml documents into other formats.  jade can
currently generate sgml, rtf, and tex.  in conjunction with the "jadetex"
tex style, it can generate quite nice output.
