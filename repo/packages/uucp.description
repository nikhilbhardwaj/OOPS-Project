Unix to unix copy program
	
uucp will copy files to or from another (usually *nix) system, which
also runs uucp.

uucp is used to transfer mail, news and random files between systems
which are not connected by more modern networks.  the communication can
be made via modems, direct (hard-wired) serial connections or via an ip
connection.
