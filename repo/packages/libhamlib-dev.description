Development library to control radio transceivers and receivers
	
most recent amateur radio transceivers allow external control of their
functions through a computer interface. unfortunately, control commands are
not always consistent across a manufacturer's product line and each
manufacturer's product line differs greatly from its competitors.

this library addresses that issue by providing a standardised programming
interface that applications can talk to and translating that into the
appropriate commands required by the radio in use.

this package provides the development library with both c bindings.
if you wish to run applications developed using this library you'll need the
'libhamlib2' package.
