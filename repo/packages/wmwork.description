Keep track of time worked on projects
	
wmwork provides a monitor on a 64x64 mini window that helps you keeping
track of your time. the idea is based on the program worklog written
by truxton king fulton ii. in contrast to worklog wmwork is a graphical
application designed to work with the windowmaker dock, but will work
with other window managers as well. wmwork's upstream homepage can be
found at http://www.godisch.de/debian/wmwork/.
