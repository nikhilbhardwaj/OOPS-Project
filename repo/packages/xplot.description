Simple on-screen x-y column data plotter
	
xplot is a small program to plot one- or two-dimensional datasets, which are
present either in a file or are generated `on-the-fly' and piped to xplot.
xplot lets you display one or more datasets and lets you zoom to different
sections of the sets. also. `blowups' of the currently shown portion of the
data can be made.

xplot is meant for on-screen data exploration.  it does not have a print
button, nor is it meant for final output or publication-quality figures.
