Create method aliases
	
the traditional way to create a method alias (provide an alternate
name for a method) is simply a glob alias.  while this works fine for
functions, it does not work for methods overloaded by a subclass.

instead, method::alias creates a number of methods in the caller's
package to call the real method. it is designed to be used as a pragma,
to which you provide a set of pairs of method names.
