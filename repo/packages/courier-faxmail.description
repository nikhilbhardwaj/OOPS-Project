Courier mail server - fax<->mail gateway
	
the courier mail transfer agent (mta) is an integrated mail/groupware
server based on open commodity protocols, such as esmtp, imap, pop3, ldap,
ssl, and http. courier provides esmtp, imap, pop3, webmail, and mailing list
services within a single, consistent, framework.

the courierfax module implements a faxmail gateway, which faxes a printed
copy of an email message to the phone number specified in the email address
(e.g. 5558888@fax).
