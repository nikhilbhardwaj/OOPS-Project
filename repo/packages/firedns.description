Runtime binaries for firedns, an asynch. dns resolver library
	
firedns is a dns resolver library.  features include asynchronous resolution,
and multi-server queries (making lookups much faster than with the stock
libc/bind functions).

the binaries included in this package use firedns to do various dns queries;
these are good for programming examples, as well as simplistic queries.
