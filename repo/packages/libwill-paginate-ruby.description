Ruby plugin adding pagination to activerecord
	
pagination is just limiting the number of records displayed, showing a
subset of them at any given view, and allowing you to move the
displayed window. this plugin makes the whole process a breeze.

willpaginate is aimed at being used from the ruby on rails framework.

this is a dummy package depending on the library for the current default
version of ruby.
