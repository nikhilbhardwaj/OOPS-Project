radiance is intended to aid lighting designers and architects by
predicting the light levels and appearance of a space prior to
construction.

this package contains common auxiliary files used by radiance, including
procedural patterns, textures and coordinate mappings, font descriptions,
compiled scene descriptions for use in instances, material definitions,
images for patterns and other examples.
