Module to execute tests defined on wiki pages
	
socialtext::wikitest executes tests defined on wiki pages.

socialtext::wikifixture is a base class that fetches and parses wiki pages
using the socialtext::resting rest api.  it then tries to execute the
commands in the wiki tables.  the code for executing the tables should
be implemented in subclasses.
