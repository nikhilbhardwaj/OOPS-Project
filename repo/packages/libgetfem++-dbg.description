Debugging symbols for the getfem++ generic finite element library
	
getfem++ is a library allowing the computation of any elementary matrix (even
for mixed finite element methods) on the largest class of methods and elements,
and for arbitrary dimension.

this package contains debugging files used to investigate problems with
binaries included in the getfem++ packages.
