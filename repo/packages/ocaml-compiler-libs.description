Ocaml interpreter and standard libraries
	
objective (ocaml) is an implementation of the ml language, based on
the caml light dialect extended with a complete class-based object system
and a powerful module system in the style of standard ml.

this package contains several modules used internally by the ocaml
compilers.  they are not needed for normal ocaml development, but may
be helpful in the development of certain applications.
