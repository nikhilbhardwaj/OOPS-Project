Apache 2 module to redirect users to the canonical hostname
	
this module can automatically issue a http redirect if someone accesses your
server with anything other than the canonical hostname. it is most useful if
you want people to be able to enter your hostname without "www." or have
multiple domains in different tlds that should all be redirected to the same
site.
