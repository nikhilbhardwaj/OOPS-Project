Extension to encode column values automatically
	
dbix::class::encodedcolumn is a dbix::class component which can automatically
encode a column's contents whenever the value of that column is set, similar
to dbix::class::digestcolumns. any data you write is automatically converted
on-the-fly and, in contrast to digestcolumns, any arbitrary message digest or
encryption method can be supported through an appropriate encoding class.
