Generic logging library
	
generic logging layer that may be used to log to one or more of syslog, an
open file handle or a file name. though due to limitations in the
implementation of syslog opening multiple syslog loggers doesn't makes
sense. includes the ability to limit which messages will be logged based on
priorities.
