Perl module for apachectl style control of another executable
	
app::control is a simple module to replicate the kind of functionality you get
with apachectl to control apache, but for any script or executable. there is a
very simple oo interface, where the constructor is used to specify the
executable, command line arguments, and pidfile, and various methods (start,
stop, etc.) are used to control the executable in the obvious way.  the module
is intended to be used in a simple wrapper control script. currently the
module does a fork and exec to start the executable, and sets the signal
handler for sigchld to 'ignore' to avoid zombie processes.
