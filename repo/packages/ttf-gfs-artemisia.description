Greek font (times greek-like)
	
the type family gfs artemisia was designed by the painter-engraver
takis katsoulidis and reflects his style and typographic acumen. it
is largely his effort to offer, from a different perspective, a type
face which, like times greek, would be applicable to a wide spectrum
of uses and equally agreeable and legible. the typeface has been
digitised by george d. matthiopoulos.
