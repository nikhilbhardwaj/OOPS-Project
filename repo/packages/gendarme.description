Extensible rule-based checker for cli assemblies
	
gendarme is a extensible rule-based tool to find problems in .net
applications and libraries. gendarme inspects programs and libraries
that contain code in ecma cil format (mono and .net) and looks for
common problems with the code, problems that compiler do not typically
check or have not historically checked.
