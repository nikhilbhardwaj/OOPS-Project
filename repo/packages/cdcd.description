Command line or console based cd player
	
cdcd works in two ways, accepting commands directly off the command line or in
a query mode similar to other unix programs. to pass a command to cdcd, simply
run cdcd with the command as the argument (e.g. cdcd play). this is great for
using cron and cdcd together to make a cd alarm clock. or you can run cdcd with
out arguments and you will be given the cdcd command prompt.
