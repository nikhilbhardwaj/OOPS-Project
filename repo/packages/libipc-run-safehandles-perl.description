Use ipc::run and ipc::run3 safely
	
ipc::run and ipc::run3 are both very upset when you try to use them under
environments where you have stdout and/or stderr tied to something else, such
as under fastcgi.

the module adds safe-guarding code when you call ipc::run or ipc::run3 under
such environment to make sure it always works.
