Development libraries and headers for glut
	
glut (as in ``gluttony'') is a window system independent toolkit for
writing opengl programs.  it implements a simple windowing api, which
makes life considerably easier when learning about and exploring opengl
programming.

glut is designed for constructing small to medium sized opengl programs,
however it is not a full-featured toolkit, so large applications requiring
sophisticated user interfaces are better off using native window system
toolkits like gtk or motif.

this package has been replaced by ``freeglut3-dev''.
