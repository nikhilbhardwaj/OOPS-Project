Dynamic tiling window manager
	
scrotwm is a minimalistic window manager that tries to stay out of the way so
that valuable screen real estate can be used for much more important stuff.

it has sane defaults and does not require one to learn a language to do any
configuration.

it was written by hackers for hackers and it strives to be small, compact
and fast.
