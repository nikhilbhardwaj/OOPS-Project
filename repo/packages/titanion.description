Strike down super high-velocity swooping insects
	
titanion is an abstract shooter game. while we fire with one button, the
other one acts as a tractor ray to attract the enemies and take them to
the combat line. the game in itself is quite simple, but with such
graphics and playability that it's worth a try.

titanion is another gem among many by kenta cho.
