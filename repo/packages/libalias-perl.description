you may find this module useful if you:


  * are tired of dereferencing hash-based object attributes



  * wish perl could make-do with fewer $, -> and {} things



  * are a little scared of using typeglobs



  * want the freedom to put what you want, when you want in
    the symbol table without having to deal with weird syntax



  * need to use scalar constants in your program since you don't
    trust yourself from changing $pi
