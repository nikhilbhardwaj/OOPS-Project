Provide access to (sm)bios information - development files
	
libsmbios aims towards providing access to as much bios information as
possible. it does this by providing a library of functions that can be
used as well as sample binaries.

it incorporates extensible access to smbios information capabilities and
ability to perform unit tests across multiple systems without using physical
hardware. moreover, centralized, data-driven exception handling for broken
bios tables is provided.

to start out with, the focus is on the smbios tables. currently, full access
to the smbios table and its items is implemented. in the future, it will
provide $pir, mptable, rci, rbu, and other tables as well.

additionally, access and manipulation of dell indexed io token (type 0xd4)
is implemented. this token is a vendor-extention smbios structure which
allows uniform access to manipulate the system cmos to enable, disable, or
otherwise manipulate normal bios functions or features.
