Lightweight virtual machine - compiler and tools
	
neko provides a common runtime for several different languages,
including javascript and haxe.

the compiler converts a source file (.neko) into a bytecode file (.n)
that can be executed with the virtual machine.  you can use the
compiler as standalone commandline executable separated from the
virtual machine, or as a neko library to perform compile-and-run for
interactive languages.

neko was written by nicolas cannasse.
