Heimdal kerberos - multi-implementation development
	
heimdal is a free implementation of kerberos 5 that aims to be
compatible with mit kerberos.

this package provides versions of the heimdal development files that
can be installed along-side mit kerberos development files.
normally, heimdal-dev should be used. however if a package needs to
build  against both heimdal kerberos and mit kerberos, then the
multidev package should be used.
