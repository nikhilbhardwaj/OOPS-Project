Library for autoconvert codepages development files
	
originally, the project was aimed to provide means to work with
multiple encodings

 * language autodetection
 * on the fly translation between languages, using online-services!
 * encoding autodetection for most of european languages1
 * support for encoding detection plugins (besides enca and librcd)
 * recoding/translation of multi-language playlists!
 * cache to speed-up re-recoding.
 * possibility to configure new languages and encodings.
 * shared configuration file. for example mentioned taglib and
   libid3 patches do not have their own user interface, but will
   utilize the same recoding configuration as xmms.
 * as well the separate program for configuration adjustment is
   available.
 * gtk/gtk2 ui library: you can add properties page to your gtk+
   application with 3 lines of code.
 * menu localization opportunity

this package contains the include files, static library and
development tools for librcc, as well as the testlibraw program.
