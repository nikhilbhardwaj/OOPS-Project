Module for typical installation tasks of system administrators
	
sysadm::install executes shell-like commands performing typical
installation tasks: copying files, extracting tarballs, calling make.
it has a fail once and die policy, meticulously checking the result
of every operation and calling die() immeditatly if anything fails.

sysadm::install also supports a dry_run mode, in which it
logs everything, but suppresses any write actions.
