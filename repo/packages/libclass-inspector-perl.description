Perl module that provides information about classes
	
class::inspector allows you to get information about a loaded class.
most or all of this information can be found in other ways, but they
aren't always very friendly, and usually involve a relatively high level
of perl wizardry, or strange and unusual looking code. class::inspector
attempts to provide an easier, more friendly interface to this
information.
