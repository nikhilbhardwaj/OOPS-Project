Slip/ppp emulator using a dial up shell account
	
slirp is a tcp/ip emulator which turns an ordinary shell account
into a (c)slip/ppp account.  this allows shell users to use all the
funky internet applications like netscape, mosaic, cuseeme, etc.

please note that maybe your isp really doesn't like you using slirp,
because they want to charge more for a ppp connection, so use it at
your own risk.
