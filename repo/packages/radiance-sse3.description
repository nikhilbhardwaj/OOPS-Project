Lighting simulation and rendering system - sse3 optimizations
	
radiance is intended to aid lighting designers and architects by
predicting the light levels and appearance of a space prior to
construction.

this package contains sse3-optimized versions of the renderers. to be able
to use them your processor needs to support the sse3 instruction set.
using optimized binaries speeds up rendering by 5-15%.
