Identify the dependencies of a distribution
	
module::depends extracts module dependencies from an unpacked
distribution tree.

module::depends only evaluates the meta.yml shipped with a
distribution.  this won't be effective until all distributions ship
meta.yml files, so we suggest you take your life in your hands and
look at module::depends::intrusive.
