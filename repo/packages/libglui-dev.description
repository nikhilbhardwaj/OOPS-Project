A glut-based c++ user interface library
	
glui provides controls such as buttons, checkboxes, radio buttons, and
spinners to opengl applications.  it is window-system independent, relying
on glut to handle all system-dependent issues, such as window and mouse
management. features of the glui user interface library include:


 - complete integration with glut toolkit
 - simple creation of a new user interface window with a single line of
   code
 - support for multiple user interface windows
 - standard user interface controls such as:
      - buttons
      - checkboxes for boolean variables
      - radio buttons for mutually-exclusive options
      - editable text boxes for inputting text, integers, and
        floating-point values
      - spinners for interactively manipulating integer and floating-point
        values
      - static text fields
      - panels for grouping sets of controls
      - separator lines to help visually organize groups of controls
 - controls can generate callbacks when their values change
 - variables can be linked to controls and automatically updated when the
   value of the control changes ("live variables")
 - controls can be automatically synchronized to reflect changes in live
   variables
 - controls can trigger glut redisplay events when their values change
 - layout and sizing of controls is automatic
 - controls can be grouped into columns
 - user can cycle through controls using tab key
