Automated package list synchronization
	
pkgsync is a tool for keeping multiple machines reasonably similar and
clean. packages can either be in a `must be installed', `may be
installed' or `must not be installed' list (which is presumed to be
distributed separately using a tool such as rdist or cfengine). pkgsync
will take care of meeting the demands put down in the lists, and then
removing everything that is not in the `must' or `may' list and is not
necessary for their operations (as determined by aptitude).
