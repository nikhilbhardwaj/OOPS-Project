Perl libraries for webauth central login server
	
webauth is a cookie-based web authentication system built on top of
kerberos.  it relies on a central authentication server that handles all
user authentication for a domain and creates user authentication
credentials for any web server that needs strong authentication.

this package contains the perl modules that support the weblogin server,
which handles user authentication and the establishment of initial
authentication credentials.
