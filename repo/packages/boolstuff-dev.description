Library for operating on boolean expression binary trees
	
boolstuff is a c++ library that supports a few operations on boolean
expression binary trees. the main features are:

 * a simple boolean expression parser (supports operators and, or and
   not, as well as parentheses)
 * an algorithm to convert a boolean expression binary tree into its
   disjunctive normal form (this algorithm supports the not operator)
 * a function that determines if an expression tree is in dnf.


this package includes the development files for using the library from
inside your programs.
