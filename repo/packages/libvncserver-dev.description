Api to write one's own vnc server - development files
	
libvncserver makes writing a vnc server (or more correctly, a program
exporting a framebuffer via the remote frame buffer protocol) easy.  it hides
the programmer from the tedious task of managing clients
and compression schemata.

this is the development package which contains headers and static libraries
for libvncserver.
