Symmetric banded matrices for octave
	
this package deals with linear algebra for symmetric banded matrices
in octave, a scientific computation software.  it contains functions
for solving a system of linear equations, find a few of the smallest
eigenvalues and eigenvectors, multiply symmetric banded matrix with
full matrix, among others.

this octave add-on package is part of the octave-forge project.
