Httpd logfile analysis package
	
wwwstat processes a sequence of httpd common logfile format access_log
files and prior summary outputs, and then outputs a summary of
the access statistics in a nice html format.

splitlog processes a sequence of httpd common logfile format access_log
files (or clf with a one-field prefix) and splits the entries into
separate files according to the requested url and/or vhost prefix.
