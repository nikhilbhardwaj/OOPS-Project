Inefficient cvs repository grabber using cvs command
	
cvssuck is a mirroring tool for cvs repositories.  unlike other tools
such as cvsup or rsync, it uses cvs command to access the repository.
so, it works well with remote repositories without a special server or
shell account.  however it is inefficient and not perfect because cvs
client/server protocol is not designed for mirroring.  if a server
provides special way to grab a repository, you shouldn't use cvssuck.
