Stores and retrieves license information in media files
	
liblicense implements the creative commons metadata standards for saving
and retrieving information about media files, including the license they
are under, where to get more information, and how to obtain further
permissions.  the library is targeted at sotware developers; end-users
probably will not intentionally install this.
