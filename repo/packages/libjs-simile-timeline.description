Javascript library for web-based interactive timelines
	
timeline is a dhtml-based ajax-based widget for visualizing time-based
events. it uses the "slippy page" concept in a similar way to google maps
allowing the user to pan the timeline by dragging the page horizontally.

each timeline can consist of multiple "bands", each with a configurable
scale, which can provide useful context when displaying a large number
of items. timelines can be populated directly via xml or json.
