Utilities to read temperature/voltage/fan sensors
	
lm-sensors is a hardware health monitoring package for linux. it allows you
to access information from temperature, voltage, and fan speed sensors. it
works with most newer systems.

this package contains a daemon that calculates fan speeds from temperatures
and sets the corresponding pwm outputs to the computed values.
