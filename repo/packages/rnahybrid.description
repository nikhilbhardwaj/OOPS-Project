Fast and effective prediction of microrna/target duplexes
	
rnahybrid is a tool for finding the minimum free energy hybridisation of a
long and a short rna. the hybridisation is performed in a kind of domain mode,
ie. the short sequence is hybridised to the best fitting part of the long one.
the tool is primarily meant as a means for microrna target prediction.
