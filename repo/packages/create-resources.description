Shared resources for use by creative applications
	
the create project provides shared resources for use by creative
applications such as blender, cinepaint, the gimp, inkscape, scribus,
audacity and the open clip art library.

the package includes brushes, color swatches files, gradients, etc. , so
that the user doesn't need to install all of these resources separately
for each and every application that can read such data.
