Server for the bootp protocol with dhcp support
	
this is a server for the bootp protocol; which allows network administrator
to setup networking information for clients via an /etc/bootptab on a server
so that the clients can automatically get their networking information.  while
this server includes rudimentary dhcp support as well, we suggest using the
dhcp package if you need dhcp support, as it is much more complete.
