Rational fortran preprocessor for fortran 77
	
ratfor77 is a preprocessor that converts the rational fortran dialect
into ordinary fortran 77. the output can then be compiled using g77
or f2c + gcc.

the ratfor dialect provides c-like control structures and some
syntactic sugar that makes fortran programs easier to read and write.
