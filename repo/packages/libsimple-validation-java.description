Library for quickly adding validation code to swing user-interfaces
	
this is a simple library for retrofitting user-interface input
validation to swing applications. it handles validating user input
when the user changes a component's value, showing error messages and
decorating components to indicate which component is the source of
the problem. it contains a large number of built-in validators to
handle most common situations, such as validating numbers, email
addresses, urls and so forth.
