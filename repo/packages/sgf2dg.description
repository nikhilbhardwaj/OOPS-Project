go is a board game from eastern asia and tex is a program for
typesetting.  sgf2dg converts go game records in smart-go format (sgf)
into tex files.  you can produce camera-ready copies for books or
magazines, or simply generate attractive printouts of your (internet)
go games.

sgf2dg includes the metafont sources for a new set of go fonts, and a
script, sgf2dg (formerly sgf2tex), which translates files in sgf-format
into tex.
