Performance co-pilot memory mapped value client library
	
the libpcp-mmv package contains the runtime environment required by an
application that utilises memory mapped value instrumentation to export
runtime instrumentation into the performance co-pilot infrastructure.

the performance co-pilot provides a unifying abstraction for
all of the interesting performance data in a system, and allows
client applications to easily retrieve and process any subset of
that data.
