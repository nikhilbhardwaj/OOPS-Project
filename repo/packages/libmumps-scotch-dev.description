Direct linear systems solver - scotch-version development files
	
mumps implements a direct solver for large sparse linear systems, with a
particular focus on symmetric positive definite matrices.  it can
operate on distributed matrices e.g. over a cluster.  it has fortran and
c interfaces, and can interface with ordering tools such as scotch.

this package is built the mumps libseq dummy sequential mpi library
with scotch support. unless you know that you specifically need this,
then you almost certainly want the libmumps-4.9.2 package.
