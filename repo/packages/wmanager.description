Window-manager selection tool used at x startup
	
wmanager is a small x11 application for selecting a window manager
at x startup. wmanager looks for a file named '.wmmanagerrc' in
the user's home directory which contains a list of window managers;
you can create such a file with wmanagerrc-update. you can also use
wmanager-loop that runs window managers chosen by the user until
told to exit.
