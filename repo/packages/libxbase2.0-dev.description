Xbase compatible c++ class library (development files)
	
xbase (formerly known as xdb, also formerly known as xbase) is a collection
of specifiations, programs, utilities and a c++ class library for
manipulating xbase type datafiles and indices.

xbase is useful for accessing data in legacy dbase 3 and 4 database files as
well as a general light-weight database engine.  it includes support for
dbf (dbase version 3 and 4) data files, ndx and ntx indexes, and dbt
(dbase version 3 and 4).  it supports file and record locking under *nix
os's.

this package contains development files for xbase and documentation
distributed with xbase.
