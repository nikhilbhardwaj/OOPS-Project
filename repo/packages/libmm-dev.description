Shared memory library - development files
	
ossp mm is a two layer abstraction library which simplifies the use of
shared memory between forked (and therefore closely related) processes.
it hides all platform-dependent aspects of the process from the user
and provides a malloc(3)-style api.

this package contains the development files required to compile
programs that use mm.
