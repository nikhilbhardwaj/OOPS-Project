Object-oriented version of the arpack package (development)
	
arpack++ is an object-oriented version of the arpack package. it consists a
collection of classes that offers c++ programmers an interface to arpack. it
preserves the full capability, performance, accuracy and low memory
requirements of the fortran package, but takes advantage of the c++
object-oriented programming environment.

arpack stands for arnoldi package and provides standard and
generalized eigenvalue solvers for sparse matrices that arises
typically from finite element codes. see the correponding debian
package.
