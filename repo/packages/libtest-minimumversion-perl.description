Perl test module to check the version of perl required
	
test::minimumversion is a simple test to look at the features you are using in
your code and determine the minimum version of the perl interpreter that is
required. this is helpful, for example, when you are using features like 'say'
which was introduced in perl 5.10.

this test makes it easy to determine if your perl code requires a newer perl
than expected, or if you accidentally made your dist require a newer version
than strictly necessary.
