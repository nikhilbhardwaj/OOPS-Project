Lv2dynparam is a lv2 plugin interface extension
	
library that enables plugin parameters to appear and disappear
(i.e. number of voices).
it also allows nested grouping of parameters.
groups can be used for things like adsr abstraction,
i.e. group of 4 float parameters.

the extension consists of a header describing the extension
interface and libraries, one for plugins and one for hosts,
to expose functionality in more usable,
from programmer point of view, interface.

this package contains the headers used to build applications
that use liblv2dynparamhost1-1 and liblv2dynparamplugin1-0.
