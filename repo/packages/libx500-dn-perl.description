Perl parser and formatter for rfc 2253 style dn strings
	
x500::dn handles x.500 dns (distinguished names). currently, it parses dn
strings formatted according to rfc 2253 syntax into an internal format and
produces rfc 2253 formatted string from it.

x500::rdn handles x.500 rdns (relative distinguished names). this is a
supporting module for x500::dn.
