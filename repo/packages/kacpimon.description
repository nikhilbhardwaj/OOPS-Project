Kernel acpi event monitor
	
modern computers support the advanced configuration and power interface (acpi)
to allow intelligent power management on your system and to query battery and
configuration status.

kacpimon is a small tool that monitors kernel acpi and keyboard events from
multiple interfaces and reports them to the console.
