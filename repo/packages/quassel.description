Distributed irc client - qt-based monolithic core+client
	
quassel is a modern, cross-platform, distributed irc client, meaning that
one or more clients can attach to and detach from the central core. it's
much like the popular combination of screen and a text-based irc client
such as weechat or irssi, but graphical.

this package provides the monolithic client. it contains both core and
client and can be used like a traditional irc client, without requiring an
external core.
