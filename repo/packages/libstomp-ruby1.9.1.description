Ruby 1.9.1 bindings for the stomp messaging protocol
	
stomp is a text-oriented wire protocol for messaging (mom/mq/jms)
type systems. this library provides two useful interfaces, a low-
level class, stomp::connection, which is a basic protocol
implementation, and stomp::client, which is designed as a higher
level convenience api.

this package contains stomp libraries for ruby 1.9.1.
