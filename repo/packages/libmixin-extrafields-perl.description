Module to add extra stashes of data to objects
	
mixin::extrafields is a perl module that provides a simple way to add an
arbitrary number of stashes for named data. these data can be stored in the
object, in a database, or anywhere else. the storage mechanism is abstracted
away from the provided interface, so one storage mechanism can be easily
swapped for another. multiple extrafields stashes can be mixed into one
class, using one or many storage mechanisms.
