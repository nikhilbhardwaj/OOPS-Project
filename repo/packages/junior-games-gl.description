Debian jr. 3d games (hardware acceleration required)
	
these games all use opengl libraries.  they will not work without
decent 3d graphics cards providing hardware-accelerated opengl.

while armagetron and gltron are different interpretations of the
game depicted in the classic 3d-animated movie "tron", tux racer
is an all-original made-for-linux 3d racing game.  unlike the
standard blood-and-guts fare in the 3d games universe, all of
these games are suitable for children.
