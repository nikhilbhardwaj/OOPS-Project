Off-the-record messaging library development files
	
off-the-record (otr) messaging library

otr allows you to have private conversations over im by providing:

 - encryption
   - no one else can read your instant messages.
 - authentication
   - you are assured the correspondent is who you think it is.
 - deniability
   - the messages you send do _not_ have digital signatures that are
     checkable by a third party.  anyone can forge messages after a
     conversation to make them look like they came from you.  however,
     _during_ a conversation, your correspondent is assured the messages
     he sees are authentic and unmodified.
 - perfect forward secrecy
   - if you lose control of your private keys, no previous conversation
     is compromised.

 this package contains the header files and static libraries needed to
 develop applications using libotr.
