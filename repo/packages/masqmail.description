Mail transport agent for intermittently connected hosts
	
masqmail is an mta (mail transport agent) and pop3 client for hosts
with no permanent network connection, such as home network servers
or notebook computers. it has special support for connections to
different internet service providers.

in these cases, masqmail is a slim replacement for full-blown mtas
such as sendmail, exim, qmail or postfix. the pop3 client can be
a small replacement for other full-featured tools like fetchmail.
