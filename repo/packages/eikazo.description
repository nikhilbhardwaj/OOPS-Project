eikazo is a graphical frontend for sane (scanner access now easy) designed
for mass-scanning, especially with scanners equiped with and adf (automatic
document feeder). its major goal is to be fast.

eikazo uses a plugin mechanism for post-processing, storage and to
support device-specific options and features.

install the python-mysqldb or the python-pygresql packages if you intend
to use the (demonstration) sql output plugin.
