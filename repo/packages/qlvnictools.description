Tools for qlogic virtual nics
	
these tools allow the use and discovery of qlogic virtual
nic (vnic) devices via the infiniband vnic protocol.
the vnic driver enables a host on an infiniband fabric
to access nodes on an external ethernet without requiring
an ethernet nic to be installed in that host.
