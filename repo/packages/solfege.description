Ear training software
	
gnu solfege is an ear training program for x window written in python,
using the gtk+ 2.0 libraries. you can practice harmonic and
melodic intervals, chords, scales and rhythms, and you can add new
exercises using a simple plain text file format.

ear training is a big subject with many connections to music theory
and performance of music, so i won't even try to make "a complete
computer-based ear training course". but i hope someone find this
software useful.
