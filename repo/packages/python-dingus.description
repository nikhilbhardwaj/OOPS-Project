A record-then-assert mocking library
	
a dingus is sort of like a mock object. the main difference is that you don't
set up expectations ahead of time. you just run your code, using a dingus in
place of another object or class, and it will record what happens to it. then,
once your code has been exercised, you can make assertions about what it did
to the dingus.
