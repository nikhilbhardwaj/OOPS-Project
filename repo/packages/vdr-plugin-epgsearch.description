Vdr plugin that provides extensive epg searching capabilities
	
this plugin for the linux video disc recorder (vdr) allows searching the epg
(electronic programme guide) data by defining search terms that can
permanently be stored in a list for later reuse. it supports regular
expressions and is capable of doing fuzzy searches. epg-search scans the epg
in background and can automatically create timers for matching search terms.
besides this it supports searching for repetitions, detection of timer
conflicts, sending emails on timer events and much more. search terms can
also be added and modified with vdradmin-am, a web frontend for vdr.
