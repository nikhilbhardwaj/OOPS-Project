Modular audio processing and synthesis system
	
galan is a sophisticated audio-processing tool (both on-line and
off-line). it allows one to build synthesisers, effects chains, mixers,
sequencers, drum-machines, and much more, in a modular fashion. it
includes basic functionality for all these tasks, and also includes
support for ladspa-compliant plugins, which greatly expand its
capabilities.
