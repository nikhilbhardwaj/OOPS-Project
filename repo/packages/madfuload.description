Firmware loader for m-audio dfu audio devices
	
this package allows you to use m-audio's dfu audio devices
with linux. these devices require a firmware download before
an operating system driver (e.g. alsa's snd-usb-audio) can
access them.

supported devices:

 - sonica
 - ozone
 - mobilepre usb (some newer models work without the loader)
 - transit

the loader is not required for some newer models of the above devices,
like the ozone academic.
