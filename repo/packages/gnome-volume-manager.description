Gnome daemon to auto-mount and manage media devices
	
gnome-volume-manager is a gnome daemon that acts as a policy agent on
top of the kernel, udev, d-bus and hal. it listens to hal events and
reacts with user-configurable actions. currently it supports automount
of new media and hot-plugged devices, autorun, autoplay for cds and
dvds, and automatic camera management. it is expected to be simple and
free of polling and other evil hacks.
