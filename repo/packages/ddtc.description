Deal with ddts mails
	
ddtc stands for debian description translation client. it's a perl script to
help both translators and reviewers to deal with ddts mails. it parses mails
from the ddts, splits them into individual package files, sends translations,
reviews and patches buggy translations.

supports only package description (pdesc) for the moment.
