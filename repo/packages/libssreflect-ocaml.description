Small scale reflection extension for coq (plugin)
	
this package is part of ssreflect, the small scale reflection
extension for coq. it provides a new tactic language, which promotes
more structured, concise and robust proof scripts, and is in fact
independent from the "reflection" proof style. it is implemented as a
linkable extension to the coq system.
