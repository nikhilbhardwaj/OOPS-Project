Partition editor for amiga partitions (cross version)
	
amiga-fdisk is, similar to fdisk for pcs, a program to partition
harddisks. though it seems to work quite well, it's still got some
sort of beta status. it's suggested that you still use the amigados
native tool "hdtoolbox" to partition your harddisks and use
amiga-fdisk only for querying partition information.
