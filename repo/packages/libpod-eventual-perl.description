Module to read a pod as a series of trivial events
	
pod::eventual is a collection of perl modules designed to read line-based
input and produce events describing each pod paragraph or directive it finds.
once complete, events are immediately passed to the handle_event method. this
method should be implemented by subclasses of pod::eventual; otherwise the
default handle_event method will raise an exception.
