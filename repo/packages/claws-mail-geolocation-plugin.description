Geolocation of senders for claws mail
	
this plugins allows geographical location of mail sender in a
map displayed in message window.

notice that inferring geographical location from mail headers is by
nature inaccurate, and some servers, mainly mail list servers, are
known to mangle message headers. mails comming from them will appear
located at the mail list server position and not at sender's position.

in case of doubt do not rely on the results shown by this plugin.
