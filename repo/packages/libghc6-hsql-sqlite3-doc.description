Api documentation of the hsql-sqlite3 library for haskell
	
hsql provides interfaces for haskell programmers to the postgresql,
mysql, sqlite, and unixodbc database systems.  there is a generic
abstract interface so that code can be used interchangeably with these
database systems.  in this sense, it is similar to java's jdbc,
python's db-api, or perl's dbi.

this package provides documentation for sqlite driver of hsql.
