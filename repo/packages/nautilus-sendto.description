Integrates evolution and pidgin into the nautilus file manager
	
the nautilus send to plugin provides the nautilus file manager with a context
menu component for quickly sending files to accounts in an evolution email
address book, contacts on a pidgin or gajim instant messaging list, through
icedove, or through claws mail.

nautilus send to also provides the option of compressing the files (tar.bz2,
tar.gz, or zip) before sending.
