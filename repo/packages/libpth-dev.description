The gnu portable threads (development)
	
pth is a very portable posix/ansi-c based library for unix platforms which
provides non-preemptive priority-based scheduling for multiple threads of
execution ("multithreading") inside server applications. all threads run in the
same address space of the server application, but each thread has its own
individual program-counter, run-time stack, signal mask and errno variable.

this package contains the development files.
