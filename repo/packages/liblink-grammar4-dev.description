Carnegie mellon university's link grammar parser (development headers)
	
in selator, d. and temperly, d. "parsing english with a link grammar"
(1991), the authors defined a new formal grammatical system called a
"link grammar". a sequence of words is in the language of a link
grammar if there is a way to draw "links" between words in such a way
that the local requirements of each word are satisfied, the links do
not cross, and the words form a connected graph. the authors encoded
english grammar into such a system, and wrote this program to parse
english using this grammar.

link-grammar can be used for linguistic parsing for information
retrieval or extraction from natural language documents. it can also be
used as a grammar checker.
