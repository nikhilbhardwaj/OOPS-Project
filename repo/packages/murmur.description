Pygtk2 client for museekd, the p2p soulseek daemon
	
museek+ is a file-sharing application for the soulseek peer-to-peer network.
it's a fork of museek which now includes nearly all features supported by
the official closed-source soulseek client (room searching, buddy-only
shares, interests, banlists, ignorelists, icon themes, font/color selecting,
etc.)

this package contains a python/gtk2 based client which looks like nicotine.
