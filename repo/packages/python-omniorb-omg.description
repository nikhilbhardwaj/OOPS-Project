Corba omg standard files for python-omniorb
	
omniorb4 is a freely available common object request broker
architecture (corba) 2.6 compliant object request broker (orb)
implementation. it is based on the iiop communications
protocol and should be interoperable with any other
corba 2.6 compliant orb.

this package includes the python files that are necessary to
fulfil the omg standard 02-09-07.  it conflicts with
python-pyorbit-omg since only one package can provide the default
corba bindings.
