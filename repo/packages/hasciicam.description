(h)ascii for the masses: live video as text
	
hasciicam makes it possible to have live ascii video on the web. it
captures video from a tv card and renders it into ascii, formatting the
output into an html page with a refresh tag or in a live ascii window or
in a simple text file as well, giving the possibility to anybody that has a
bttv card, a linux box and a cheap modem line to show a live ascii video
feed that can be browsable without any need for plugin, java etc.
