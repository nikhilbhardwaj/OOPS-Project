Bibtex search tool
	
search-citeseer is a perl script that connects to citeseer
(http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/cs), and performs a keyword search
query. the result is a set of bibtex entries that matches the query.

if you use some emacsen application, this package will install the
search-citeseer.el script on it.
