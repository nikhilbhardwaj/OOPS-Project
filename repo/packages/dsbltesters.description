Open proxy/relay testing utilities
	
this package contains testing software configured to work with
the dsbl (http://dsbl.org/) or dsbl-compliant services.  it
enables you to send tests to servers based on spam that you
receive.  if those tests succeed, the results will reach the
dsbl host in question, and the relay will be listed.

note: the original dsbl service has gone, it's not possible to
submit nor place a query there.
