A quake-style terminal emulator based on kde konsole technology
	
yakuake is inspired from the terminal in the quake game: when you press a key
(by default f12, but that can be changed) a terminal window slides down from
the top of the screen. press the key again, and the terminal slides back.

it is faster than a keyboard shortcut because it is already loaded into memory
and as such is very useful to anyone who frequently finds themselves switching
in and out of terminal sessions.
