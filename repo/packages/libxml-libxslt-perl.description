Perl module for using the gnome libxslt library
	
xml::libxslt is a fast xslt library, based on the gnome libxslt engine.

performance is currently about twice that of xml::sablotron (based on
xsltmark tests converted to perl).

the libxslt processor is also highly standards compliant, with
practically all of xslt 1.0 being supported in version 0.9 of
libxslt.
