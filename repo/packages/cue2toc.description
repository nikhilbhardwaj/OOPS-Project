Converts cue files to cdrdao's toc format
	
cue files are text files describing the layout of a cd-rom and typically carry
the extension ".cue".  cdrdao and cdrecord, the two cd recording programs for
linux systems, cannot read these files.  this program converts cue files into
the toc format that cdrdao can understand.

it also features automatic data format conversion (e.g., mp3 to wav) before
burning; the exact action taken is determined by the file extensions and the
user's configuration.
