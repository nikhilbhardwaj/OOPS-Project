System v and posix timezone strings
	
an instance of this class represents a timezone that was specified by means
of a system v timezone string or the posix extended form of the same syntax.
these can express a plain offset from universal time, or a system of two
offsets (standard and daylight saving time) switching on a yearly cycle
according to certain types of rule.

this class implements the datetime::timezone interface, so that its instances
can be used with datetime objects.
