Parallel graph partitioning and sparse matrix ordering libs: devel
	
parmetis computes minimal-cut partitions of graphs and meshes in parallel, and
orders variables for minimal fill when using direct solvers for sparse
matrices.  it does all this in parallel, and also can efficiently re-partition
a graph or mesh whose connectivity has changed.

this package contains files needed to develop programs using parmetis.
