Mms (e.g. mms://) stream downloader
	
mimms is a program designed to allow you to download streams using the
mms protocol and save them to your computer, as opposed to watching them
live. similar functionality is available in full media player suites such
as xine, mplayer, and vlc, but mimms is quick and easy to use, and for the
time being, remains a useful program.
