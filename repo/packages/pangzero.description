Action game that involves popping balloons with a harpoon
	
pang zero is a clone and enhancement of super pang, a fast-paced action
game that involves popping balloons with a harpoon.

the intention is to create a fun, open-source game that many (currently
up to 6) people can play together. you can play pang zero alone, but it's
a lot more fun to play with your friends.
