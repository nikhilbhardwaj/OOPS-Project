Geographic objects support for postgresql -- jdbc support
	
postgis adds support for geographic objects to the postgresql object-relational
database. in effect, postgis "spatially enables" the postgresql server,
allowing it to be used as a backend spatial database for geographic information
systems (gis), much like esri's sde or oracle's spatial extension. postgis
follows the opengis "simple features specification for sql".

this package contains jdbc support for postgis.
