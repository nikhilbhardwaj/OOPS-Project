X.org x server -- amd/ati radeon display driver
	
this package provides the 'radeon' driver for the amd/ati radeon, firegl,
firemv, firepro and firestream series.

note that this is not the same as the ati-provided, binary-only, 'fglrx'
driver, which provides additional 3d functionality for some newer radeon
cards, but is not supported.

this package is built from the x.org xf86-video-ati driver module.
