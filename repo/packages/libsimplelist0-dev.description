Memory-efficient generic linked list library
	
sl doesn't use container nodes. instead it requires a pointer to the
next item directly in the datastructure you want to create lists (or
stacks) of. this can give you significant memory savings when
creating long lists of small structures. it also allows for fast push
and pop operations since there is no need to allocate or free memory
for the container nodes. it also means that a push can't fail because
memory couldn't be allocated for the container node.

this package has the development headers and static libraries.
