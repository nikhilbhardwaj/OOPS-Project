Extensible multi-dimensional simulator
	
xmds is a code generator that integrates equations, from ordinary
differential equations (odes) up to stochastic partial differential
equations (pdes). you write them down in human readable form in an
xml file, and it goes away and writes and compiles a c++ program that
integrates those equations as fast as it can possibly be done in your
architecture.
