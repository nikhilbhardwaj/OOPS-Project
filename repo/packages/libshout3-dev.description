Mp3/ogg vorbis broadcast streaming library (development)
	
a library for communicating with and sending data to icecast and icecast 2
streaming audio servers.  it handles the socket connection, the timing of
the data transmission, and prevents bad data from getting to the server.

with just a few lines of code, a programmer can easily turn any application
into a streaming source for an icecast-based server.  libshout also allows
developers who want a specific feature set (database access, request taking)
to concentrate on that feature set, instead of worrying about how server
communication works.

this package contains the development headers, static libraries, and source
code to an example program.
