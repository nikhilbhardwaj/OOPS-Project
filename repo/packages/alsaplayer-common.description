Pcm player designed for alsa (common files)
	
alsaplayer is a pcm player designed specifically for use with alsa, but
works great with oss or esound.  it's heavily threaded which cuts down on
skipping, offers optional and even simultaneous visual scopes, plays
mp3, mp2, ogg, cdda, audiofs, and lots more.

this package contains the main alsaplayer program, and needs one interface
plugin and one output plugin. by default, gtk+ interface and alsa output will
be installed.
