Module for manipulating configuration files through augeas
	
config::augeas is a perl module that provides an object-oriented interface to
the augeas open source configuration library. the api is more "perlish" than
its c counterpart, making it natural to use with perl.

augeas is a library and command line tool that addresses the common problem
of handling configuration data, providing a means to easily edit many types
of configuration files. (see the augeas package for details)
