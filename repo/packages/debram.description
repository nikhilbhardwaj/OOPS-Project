Ramified catalog of available .debs
	
debian gnu/linux provides thousands upon daunting thousands of software
packages.  sorting them into broad classes then dividing and redividing
them into finer, more specific branches, the debram ramifies debian's
packages in much the same manner as a university library ramifies its
books.  if you know what you want your computer to do but do not yet
know the package to do it, you can find the package here.
