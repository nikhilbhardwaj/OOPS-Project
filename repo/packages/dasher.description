A graphical predictive text input system
	
dasher is an information-efficient text-entry interface, driven by natural
continuous pointing gestures. dasher is a competitive text-entry system
wherever a full-size keyboard cannot be used - for example,


 * on a palmtop computer
 * on a wearable computer
 * when operating a computer one-handed, by joystick, touchscreen, trackball,
 or mouse
 * when operating a computer with zero hands (i.e., by head-mouse or by
 eyetracker).


the eyetracking version of dasher allows an experienced user to write text
as fast as normal handwriting - 25 words per minute; using a mouse,
experienced users can write at 39 words per minute.

dasher uses a more advanced prediction algorithm than the t9(tm) system
often used in mobile phones, making it sensitive to surrounding context.
