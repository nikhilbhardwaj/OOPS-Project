Trigger actions when files hit an incoming directory
	
inoticoming is a daemon to watch a directory with linux's inotify
framework and trigger actions once files with specific names are placed
in there.

for example it can be used to wait for .changes files uploaded
into a directory and call reprepro to put them into your repository.
