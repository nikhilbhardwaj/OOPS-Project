A graphical menu editor for openbox
	
obmenu is a graphical menu editor for the openbox window manager.
openbox uses xml to store its menu preferences, and editing these by hand
can quickly become tedious. this utility provides a convenient method of
editing the menu in a graphical interface, while not losing the powerful
features of openbox such as its pipe menus.

this also provides a python module named obxml that can be used to further
script openbox's menu system.
