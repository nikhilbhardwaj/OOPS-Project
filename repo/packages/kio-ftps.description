An ftps kio slave for kde 4
	
an ftps kio slave for kde 4, based on rfc4217 and build upon the ftp kio-slave
sources. it should work yet with most server implementations. it issues an
"auth tls" command after connecting and refuses to continue, when it's not
supported. in prior to every data channel io command ("stor", "retr", etc) it
tries to secure the data channel via "pbsz" and "prot" commands. if that fails
it will transfer data unencrypted. there is currently no support for
ssl-certificates. this might be added on demand.
