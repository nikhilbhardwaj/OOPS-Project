Make your object constructors blow up on unknown attributes
	
"use moosex::strictconstructor" instead of just "use moose" makes your
constructors strict. if your constructor is called with an attribute
init argument that your class does not declare, then it calls
"carp::confess()". this is a great way to catch small typos.
