Flexible, ruby based make
	
similar to make, the rant commandline tool reads a file called rantfile, which
contains task definitions. unlike make, however, an rantfile is just a valid
script written in the ruby programming language. since ruby comes with many
useful libraries and is portable across many different operating systems, it
is easy to write portable rantfiles.
