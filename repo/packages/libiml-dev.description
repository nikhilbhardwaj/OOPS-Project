Integer matrix library, development files
	
iml is a library for exact, dense linear algebra over the integers.
iml contains algorithms for nonsingular rational system solving,
computing the right nullspace of an integer matrix, and certified
linear system solving.

in addition, iml provides some low level routines for a variety of
mod p matrix operations: computing the row-echelon form, determinant,
rank profile, and inverse of a mod p matrix.  these mod p routines
are not general purpose; they require that p satisfy some
preconditions based on the dimension of the input matrix (usually p
should be prime and should be no more than about 20 bits long).

this package contains development files for iml.
