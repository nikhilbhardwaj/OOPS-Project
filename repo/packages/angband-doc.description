Documentation for the roguelike game angband.
	
angband is a single-player, text-based, dungeon simulation derived
from the game moria, which was in turn based on rogue. this package
contains additional documentation and spoilers for the game.

angband has been written by several generations of programmers over
the years, and is derived from an earlier game called moria, and the
documentation has been (often haphazardly) accumulated over time as
well.
