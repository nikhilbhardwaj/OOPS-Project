Image processing libraries providing imagemagick interface
	
graphicsmagick provides libraries in several programming languages to read,
write and manipulate image files across a large number of formats, from the
widely used jpeg, tiff, bmp or xpm to special-purpose formats such as fits or
image formats found on some photo cds. there are functions for finegrained
image processing tasks, as well as conversion routines between the various
image formats.

the graphicsmagick libraries are a fork of imagemagick and therefore offer
programming interfaces that are mostly compatible. while there might be
small differences, experience tells that many programs only use a compatible
subset and build fine with either graphicsmagick or imagemagick.

while graphicsmagick uses different names for libraries, classes, and
helper applications in order to coexist with imagemagick, this package
intends to minimise porting efforts by exporting the graphicsmagick
interface with the usual imagemagick names. note that this package only
tries to provide build-time compatibility. run-time libraries of
imagemagick and graphicsmagick are incompatible and cannot be interchanged.

this package includes compatibility wrappers for the c, c++, and perl
libraries.
