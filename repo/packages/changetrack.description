Monitor changes to (configuration) files
	
a program to automatically monitor changes to a set of files.  if
files are modified one day, and the machine stops working correctly
some days later, changetrack provides information on which files were
modified, and thus helps locate the problem.  if you tell changetrack
to use either the line editor ed (the default) or the revision
control system (rcs), you can recover files to any previous stage.
if you do not want to install perl, try out the filetraq or diffmon
package.  another similar program is etckeeper.
