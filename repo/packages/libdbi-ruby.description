Database independent interface for ruby
	
ruby/dbi is a database independent interface for accessing databases,
similar to perl's dbi.

this package contains ruby/dbi documentation and provides dependency on
the package containing common dbi libraries for the default ruby
version (currently 1.8).

database-specific drivers are located in libdbd-*-ruby packages.
