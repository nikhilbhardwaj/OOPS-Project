Xml-based template compiler
	
chameleon compiles templates to python byte-code. it includes a complete
implementation of the zope page templates (zpt) language.

the engine itself performs 10-15 times better than the reference
implementation and real-world benchmarks show an overall performance
improvement in complex applications of 30-50%.
