Tools for generating an initramfs
	
this package contains tools to create and boot an initramfs for packaged 2.6
linux kernel. the initramfs is a gzipped cpio archive. at boot time, the
kernel unpacks that archive into ram, mounts and uses it as initial root file
system. the mounting of the real root file system occurs in early user space.
klibc provides utilities to setup root. having the root on md, lvm2, luks or
nfs is also supported.
any boot loader with initrd support is able to load an initramfs archive.
