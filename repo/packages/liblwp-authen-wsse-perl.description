Library for enabling x-wsse authentication in lwp
	
lwp::authen::wsse allows lwp to authenticate against servers that are using
the x-wsse authentication scheme, as required by the atom authentication api.

the module is used indirectly through lwp, rather than including it directly in
your code.  the lwp system will invoke the wsse authentication when it
encounters the authentication scheme while attempting to retrieve a url from a
server.
