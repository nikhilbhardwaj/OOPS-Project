Emacs mode for editing tads code
	
this package provides an (x)emacs mode which makes it easier to edit
source code for tads games.  tads implements a programming language
especially designed for writing text adventures; interpreters for the
resulting byte-code are available for most operating systems
(including debian gnu/linux, in the tadsr package).
