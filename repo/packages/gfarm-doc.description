a distributed storage network, implementing the grid datafarm
architecture for global petascale data-intensive computing. it solves
performance and reliability problems in nfs and afs by means of
multiple file replicas, and not only prevents performance degradation
due to access concentration, but also supports fault tolerance and
disaster recovery.
