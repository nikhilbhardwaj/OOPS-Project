Interface between emacs lisp and python
	
pymacs is a powerful tool which, once started from emacs, allows
both-way communication between emacs lisp and python. pymacs aims
python as an extension language for emacs rather than the other way
around, and this asymmetry is reflected in some design
choices. within emacs lisp code, one may load and use python
modules. python functions may themselves use emacs services, and
handle emacs lisp objects kept in emacs lisp space.
