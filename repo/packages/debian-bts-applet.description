Gnome panel applet for monitoring the status of debian bugs
	
debian-bts-applet is a gnome panel applet for monitoring the status of bugs
filed in the debian bug tracking system (bts).

it provides a more desktop-centric way of "subscribing" to bugs compared to
the xxxxx-subscribe@bugs.debian.org method as well as providing an
"at-a-glance" view of all subscribed bugs. it also provides a libnotify
desktop notification when subscribed bugs' statuses change.
