Ctdb debugging symbols and test suite
	
ctdb is a cluster implementation of the tdb database used by samba and other
projects to store temporary data. if an application is already using tdb for
temporary data it is very easy to convert that application to be cluster aware
and use ctdb instead.

more detailed description can be found in the ctdb package.

this package provides debugging information and test suite for ctdb. install it
to get a better backtrace in the event of a crash, or to test.
