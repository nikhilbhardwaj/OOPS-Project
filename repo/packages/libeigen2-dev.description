Lightweight c++ template library for linear algebra
	
eigen 2 is a lightweight c++ template library for vector and matrix math,
a.k.a. linear algebra.

unlike most other linear algebra libraries, eigen 2 focuses on the simple
mathematical needs of applications: games and other opengl apps, spreadsheets
and other office apps, etc. eigen 2 is dedicated to providing optimal speed
with gcc.
