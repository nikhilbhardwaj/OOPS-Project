Library of linear algebra routines 3 - testing programs
	
this package is a binary incompatible upgrade to the lapack-test
package. the (minor) incompatibilities are entirely due to changes in
the blas library, against which this library is linked. please see the
documentation for the refblas3 package for details.

lapack version 3.x is a comprehensive fortran library that does
linear algebra operations including matrix inversions, least
squared solutions to linear sets of equations, eigenvector
analysis, singular value decomposition, etc. it is a very
comprehensive and reputable package that has found extensive
use in the scientific community.

these testing programs have been run against the
shared library in the lapack package.  the results have been
collected in the files test_results.  these
programs are provided separately here so that the user can
test and compare alternate versions of the lapack libraries,
such as those provided by the atlas packages, and the lapack99
package.
