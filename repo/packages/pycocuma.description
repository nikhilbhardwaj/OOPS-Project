Pythonic contact and customer management
	
pycocuma (pythonic contact and customer management) provides a personal
information system for addresses, telephone numbers and other data associated
with personal contacts (also supports photographic pictures).

pycocuma is purely written in python with a tk graphical interface. pycocuma
is based on an xml-rpc client-server architecture. the server stores its data
in compatible vcard (ver. 3.0) files (*.vcf) which can be read by all modern
address programs (evolution, kaddressbook, outlook, gnomecard, etc).
