Utility to download/decode metar reports
	
metar is a small utility that will download meteorological reports for
aviation from the noaa http server at weather.noaa.gov and optionally decodes
them into a human readable form.

this package is particularly useful is you want to quickly find out what the
weather is like in places all over the world and you do not need fancy guis.
