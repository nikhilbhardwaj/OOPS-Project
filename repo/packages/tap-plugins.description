Tom's audio processing ladspa plugins
	
tom szilagyi has written a number of plugins for ladspa
compatible hosts (e.g. ardour, gnu sound and gstreamer).

the plugins (equalizer, reverberator, stereo echo, tremolo,
scaling limiter, autopanner and deesser) have been written
primarily for ardour but should work well with any ladspa
host.
