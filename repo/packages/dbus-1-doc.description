Simple interprocess messaging system (documentation)
	
d-bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and corba in
terms of complexity.

this package contains the api documentation for d-bus, as well as
the protocol specification.

see the dbus description for more information about d-bus in general.
