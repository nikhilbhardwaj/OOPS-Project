Realtime apache monitoring tool
	
apache top is a curses-based realtime utility to display information from a
running copy of apache.

it is modelled after the standard 'top' utility, and displays information such
as the requests pers second, bytes per second and the most popular urls
displayed.

it must be run from a machine running apache, as it works by processing the
logfiles found in /var/log/apache.
