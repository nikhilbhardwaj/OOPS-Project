Bayesian spam filter
	
bsfilter is a spam filter which can distinguish spam mail from other mails.
it can read mails by three way:

  * reads from normal file or stdin.
  * retrieves and stores from imap server.
  * reads from pop server and passes to pop client. (pop proxy)

bsfilter gives nice support of japanese.
