Taglib audio meta-data library
	
taglib is a library for reading and editing the meta-data of several popular
audio formats. currently it supports both id3v1 and id3v2 for mp3 files, ogg
vorbis comments and id3 tags and vorbis comments in flac files.

this package is the main metapackage for the taglib audio meta-data library.
packages using taglib should depend on this package rather than specific
taglib flavour. vanilla (original) flavour is default. alternatively you may
install rusxmms flavour which can be found in the libtag1-rusxmms package.
