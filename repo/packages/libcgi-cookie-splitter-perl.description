Split big cookies into smaller ones
	
rfc 2109 reccomends that the minimal cookie size supported by the client is
4096 bytes. this has become a pretty standard value, and if your server sends
larger cookies than that it's considered a no-no.

cgi::cookie::splitter provides a pretty simple interface to generate small
cookies that are under a certain limit, without wasting too much effort.
