Internet time plugin for gkrellm
	
gkrellm itime is the internet time plugin for gkrellm.

internet time is a concept by swatch that divides the virtual and real
day into 1000 "beats".  a beat is 1 minute and 26.4 seconds long. this is
a global concept, therefore no timezones are needed.

swatch created a new meridian in biel, switzerland, the home of the
company.  this meridian is called biel mean time (bmt) and will be the
universal reference for the internet time.

the internet time is represented with an "@" before the number of beats.
a day in the internet time begins at midnight bmt (@000) in central europe
wintertime, and 12 o'clock noon in biel, switzerland, happens at @500 bmt.
