Lightweight text file and man page viewer
	
see is a lightweight linux text file and man page viewer. it maintains
"document meta-data" for each user, allowing them to automatically keep
bookmarks and highlights for read-only system files. it also has a
"server mode" so that command line requests can be sent to a single
running server rather than starting multiple instances. other features
include hypertext-style apropos (man page) searches, file monitoring,
regular expressions, command history, and nice little
toggle lights on the interface for the server and file monitor.
