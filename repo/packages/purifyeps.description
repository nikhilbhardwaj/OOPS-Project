Creates eps files usable in tex and pdftex
	
while pdflatex has a number of nice features, its primary shortcoming
relative to standard latex+dvips is that it is unable to read ordinary
encapsulated postscript (eps) files, the most common graphics format
in the latex world. purifyeps converts eps files into a "purified"
form that can be read by *both* latex+dvips and pdflatex.
