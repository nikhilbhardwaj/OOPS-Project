Makefile generator for java programs
	
mmake will generate a master makefile for your java programs.
this generated makefile fully understands the subdirectories
that are required if your program consists of multiple packages.
mmake also automatically generates dependencies, and can use
the c preprocessor for java programs and generate javadoc documentation.
mmake defaults to using sun's javac from the jdk but can easily use
guavac or a different gpl alternative as well.
