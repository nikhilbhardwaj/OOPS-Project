Cgi::untaint::date - validate a date
	
this input handler for cgi::untaint verifies that it is dealing with
a reasonable date.  reasonably means anything that date::manip thinks
is sensible, so you could use any of (for example): "december 12,
2001" "12th december, 2001" "2001-12-12" "next tuesday" "third
wednesday in march"
