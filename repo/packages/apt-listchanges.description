Package change history notification tool
	
the tool apt-listchanges can compare a new version of a
package with the one currently installed and show what has been
changed, by extracting the relevant entries from the debian changelog
and news files.

it can be run on several .deb archives at a time to get a list of all
changes that would be caused by installing or upgrading a group of
packages. when configured as an apt plugin it will do this
automatically during upgrades.
