Transforms a png image to a web page
	
png2html takes a png image and transforms it pixel by pixel to a web page,
encoding each pixel as an appropriately coloured letter. it is decided which
letter to encode each pixel as by using a text file supplied by the user. an
example can be found on the project's homepage.
