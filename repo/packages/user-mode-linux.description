User-mode linux (kernel)
	
user-mode linux (uml) is a port of the linux kernel to its own system
call interface.  it provides a kind of virtual machine, which runs
linux as a user process under another linux kernel.  this is useful
for kernel development, sandboxes, jails, experimentation, and many
other things.

this package contains the kernel itself, as an executable program,
and the associated kernel modules.
