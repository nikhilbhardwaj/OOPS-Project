Graphical satellite tracking client program
	
the gsat program is a graphical client for the 'predict' satellite tracking
program running in server mode, built using gtk.

since this program can be run on a different machine than predict, there is
no dependency specified... but you need access to a copy of 'predict'
installed somewhere on the network for this programs to be useful!
