Create a cd9660 or ffs file system image from a directory tree
	
netbsdÂ® makefs(8) creates a file system image from a directory tree
without the need for superuser privileges. the mirbsd version fixes
ecma 119, susp and rrip (rock ridge) compliance and adds features.

supported target filesystem types are:


   cd9660   iso 9660 (ecma 119) compatible filesystem images, with
            rock ridge, el torito, and other features
   ffs      4.2ffs, the bsd fast filesystem, also known as ufs1;
            ufs2 (with "-o version=2")


the images created can be of a fixed (predefined) size, given on the
command line, or sized automatically. permission bits are taken from
the source directory tree but may be overridden using an mtree file.
