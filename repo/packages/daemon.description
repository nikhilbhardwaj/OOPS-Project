Turns other processes into daemons
	
there are many tasks that need to be performed to correctly set up a
daemon process. this can be tedious. daemon performs these tasks for
other processes. this is useful for writing daemons in languages other
than c, c++ or perl (e.g. /bin/sh, java).

if you want to write daemons in languages that can link against c functions
(e.g. c, c++), see libslack which contains the core functionality of daemon.
