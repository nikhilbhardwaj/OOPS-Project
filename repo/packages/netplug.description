Network link monitor daemon
	
this daemon monitors the link status of network cards and configures
the network on plug- and un-plug-events.

it's similar to ifplugd, but uses netlink instead of regularly polling
the link status. this improves power-consumption with laptops, but does
not work with all network card.
