Traits-capable windowing framework
	
the traitsgui project contains a toolkit-independent gui abstraction layer
(known as pyface), which is used to support the "visualization" features of
the traits package. thus, you can write code in terms of the traits api
(views, items, editors, etc.), and let traitsgui and your selected toolkit
and back-end take care of the details of displaying them.

you can use qt or wx backends.
