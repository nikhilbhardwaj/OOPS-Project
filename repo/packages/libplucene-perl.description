A perl port of the lucene search engine
	
plucene is a fully-featured and highly customizable search engine toolkit
based on the lucene api. (http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene)

it is not, in and of itself, a functional search engine - you are expected
to subclass and tie all the pieces together to suit your own needs.
the synopsis above gives a rough indication of how to use the engine
in simple cases. see plucene::simple for one example of tying it
all together.
