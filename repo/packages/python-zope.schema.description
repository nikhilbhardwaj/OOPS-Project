Zope.interface extension for defining data schemas
	
schemas extend the notion of interfaces to detailed descriptions of
attributes (but not methods).  every schema is an interface and
specifies the public fields of an object.  a *field* roughly
corresponds to an attribute of a python object.  but a field provides
space for at least a title and a description.  it can also constrain
its value and provide a validation method.  besides you can optionally
specify characteristics such as its value being read-only or not
required.
