Extract out pre-defined slices of an ascii file
	
the slice program reads an input file and divide its prepared ascii contents
into possibly overlapping slices. these slices are determined by enclosing
blocks which are defined by begin and end delimiters which have to be
already in the file. the final output gets calculated by a slice term
consisting of slice names, set theory operators and optional round brackets.
