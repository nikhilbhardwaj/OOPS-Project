Measure the time difference between networked computers
	
clockdiff computes the difference between the time of the machine on
which it is called and the time of other network-accessible machines.
the time differences measured by clockdiff are obtained using a
sequence of icmp tstamp messages which are returned to the sender by
the ip module in the remote machine.
