Automatically install a add-on skeleton
	
makes it possible to create a package that updates the system
with the skel installed to /usr/share/dpsyco/skel.

this makes it possible to overwrite files (on top of) the ordinary
debian file system. when the file is removed from this skeleton
the original file will also be restored. if there were no original
file it will be removed.

you can also use replaces in the control field of a package to make
similar functionality of this package.
