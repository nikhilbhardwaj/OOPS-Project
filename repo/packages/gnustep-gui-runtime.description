Gnustep gui library - runtime files
	
the gnustep gui library is a powerful library of graphical user interface
classes written completely in the objective-c language; the classes are
based upon the openstep specification, and provide the user with a
traditional nextstep-like look and feel.

this package contains the runtime support files needed by gnustep gui
applications.
