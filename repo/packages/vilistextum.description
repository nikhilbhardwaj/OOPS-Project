A html to text converter
	
vilistextum is a small and fast html to text / ascii converter
specifically programmed to get the best out of incorrect html. it is
quite fault-tolerant and deals well with badly-formed or otherwise
quirky html. it is able to optimize for ebook reading, collapse
multiple blank lines, and create footnotes out of links.
