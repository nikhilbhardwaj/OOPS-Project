Adapter for vst an vsti audio plugins
	
dssi-vst is an adapter that allows users of linux audio software to take vst
and vsti audio effects and instrument plugins compiled for windows, and load
them into native ladspa or dssi plugin hosts. plugins run at full speed for
most audio processing, although their user interfaces are slower because of
the windows emulation.
