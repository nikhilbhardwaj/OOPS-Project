Configure pam to create a local user if it do not exist already
	
when the user log in for the first time, a local user is created in
/etc/passwd and primary group created in /etc/group, and a local home
directory is created in /home.  this is useful on roaming computers when
the password is set up to be cached by for example libpam-ccreds or sssd
to allow login without network connectivity using the password provided
by a network authentication service like kerberos or ldap.
