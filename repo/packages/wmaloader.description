Firmware downloader for linksys wma11b media adapter
	
wmaloader is a simple program that can download filesystem images to
the linksys wma11b. it performs the same function as the windows
xp/2000 digital media adapter application loader (supplied with the
original software) but can run on other operating systems. this
allows the linksys wireless media adapter to be booted from a linux
system. it does *not* supply media files to the device (yet!) but
even so it might prove useful to those who wish to experiment hacking
the device.
