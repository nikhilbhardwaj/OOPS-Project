Implements a flat filesystem in perl
	
file::flat implements a flat filesystem. a flat filesystem is a filesystem
in which directories do not exist. it provides an abstraction over any normal
filesystem which makes it appear as if directories do not exist.

in effect, it will automatically create directories as needed. this is create
for things like install scripts and such, as you never need to worry about the
existance of directories, just write to a file, no matter where it is.
