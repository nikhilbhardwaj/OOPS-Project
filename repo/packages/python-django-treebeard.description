Efficient implementations of tree data structures for django
	
django treebeard is a library that implements efficient data structures for
storing hierachical data in a database using the django web development
framework.

it currently includes 3 different tree implementations: adjacency list,
materialized path and nested sets. each one has it's own strengths and
weaknesses but share the same api, so itâ€™s easy to switch between them.
