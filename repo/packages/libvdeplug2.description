Virtual distributed ethernet - plug library
	
vde is a virtual switch that can connect multiple virtual machines together,
both local and remote.

components of the vde architecture are vde switches (virtual counterpart of
ethernet switches) and vde cables (virtual counterpart of a crossed-cable used
to connect two switches).

this package contains a library that makes programs able to connect to a local
vde switch. the simplest one is vde_plug, contained in the vde2 package.
