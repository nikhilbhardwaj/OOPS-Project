Extensible graphical command execution shell
	
hotwire is a primary replacement for a terminal emulator, with an
innovative graphical user interface, oriented towards developers and
system administrators. it can natively do about 80-90% of what one
would normally do in a terminal with a shell, and can also embed a
terminal by itself.
