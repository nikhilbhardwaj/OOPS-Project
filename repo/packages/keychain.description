Key manager for openssh
	
keychain is an openssh key manager, typically run from ~/.bash_profile. when
keychain is run, it checks for a running ssh-agent, otherwise it starts one.
it saves the ssh-agent environment variables to ~/.keychain/\$\{hostname\}-sh,
so that subsequent logins and non-interactive shells such as cron jobs can
source the file and make passwordless ssh connections.  in addition, when
keychain runs, it verifies that the key files specified on the command-line
are known to ssh-agent, otherwise it loads them, prompting you for a password
if necessary.
