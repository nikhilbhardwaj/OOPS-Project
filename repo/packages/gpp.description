A general-purpose preprocessor with customizable syntax
	
gpp is a general-purpose preprocessor with customizable syntax, suitable for
a wide range of preprocessing tasks. its independence from any one
programming language makes it much more versatile than the c preprocessor
(cpp), while its syntax is lighter and more flexible than that of gnu m4.
there are built-in macros for use with c/c++, latex, html, xhtml, and prolog
files.
