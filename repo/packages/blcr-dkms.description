Dkms support for blcr kernel module
	
this package provides integration with the dkms infrastructure for
automatically building out of tree kernel modules.

blcr (berkeley lab checkpoint/restart) allows programs running on
linux to be "checkpointed" (written entirely to a file), and then
later "restarted".
