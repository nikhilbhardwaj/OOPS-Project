Tunnels a data stream in http requests
	
creates a bidirectional virtual data stream tunnelled in
http requests. the requests can be sent via a http proxy
if so desired.

this can be useful for users behind restrictive firewalls. if www
access is allowed through a http proxy, it's possible to use
httptunnel and, say, telnet or ppp to connect to a computer
outside the firewall.
