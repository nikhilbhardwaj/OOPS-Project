Jane street's standard library for ocaml - extensions
	
core is an alternative to the ocaml standard library developed by
jane street capital.

core does a number of things:


 * provides tail recursive versions of non tail recursive functions in
   the standard library;
 * changes the signature of many of the standard modules to enforce
   consistent naming conventions;
 * includes generic serialization for most types;
 * adds some new modules as well as new functionality to existing
   modules.


beware that core extends some functionality of the legacy standard
library, and outright changes or replaces other; backward compatibility
with the legacy standard library has not to be expected.

the code of core is routinely reviewed within jane street capital
according to their quality assurance requirements. the extra library
called core_extended adds new functionalities on top of core, but is
only reviewed on an ad-hoc basis.

this package contains the development stuff you need to use
core_extended in your programs.
