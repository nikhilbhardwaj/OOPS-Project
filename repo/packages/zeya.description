A web music server
	
zeya is a streaming music server that brings your music to any computer
with a web browser. it reads your music library, lets you browse your
files, and streams them on demand.

the client runs entirely in the browser using the html5 draft standard
technologies (no plugins or external players are needed).

this package includes the zeya http server and a small command-line
client for machines where no html5-capable browser is available.
