Zeroconf lirc daemon using input event devices
	
this is a small lirc-compatible daemon that reads from /dev/input/eventx
devices and sends the received keycodes to connecting lirc clients. inputlircd
needs no configuration, it uses the standardised names for the keycodes as
used by the kernel. many usb remote controls that present hid devices, as well
as multimedia keyboards should work out of the box.
