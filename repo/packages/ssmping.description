Check your multicast connectivity
	
tools to check whether you can receive source specific multicast (ssm)
or any source multicast (asm) via either ipv4 or ipv6

if a host runs ssmpingd, users on other hosts can use the ssmping client
to test whether they can receive ssm from the host. another program
called asmping is also provided to check whether can receive asm.
