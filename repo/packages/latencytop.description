A tool for developers to visualize system latencies
	
latencytop is a linux tool for software developers (both kernel
and userspace), aimed at identifying where in the system latency
is happening, and what kind of operation/action is causing the
latency to happen so that the code can be changed to avoid the
worst latency hiccups.
