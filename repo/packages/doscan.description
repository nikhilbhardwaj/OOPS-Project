Port scanner for discovering services on large networks
	
doscan is a tool to discover tcp services on your network. it is
designed for scanning a single ports on a large network.  doscan
contacts many hosts in parallel, using standard tcp sockets provided
by the operating system.  it is possible to send strings to remote
hosts, and collect the banners they return.

there are better tools for scanning many ports on a small set of
hosts, for example nmap.
