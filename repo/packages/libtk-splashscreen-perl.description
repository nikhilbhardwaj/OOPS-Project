Toplevel mega widget to display a splashscreen
	
for programs that require large load times, it's a common practice to
display a splashscreen that occupies the user's attention. this toplevel
mega widget provides all the display, destroy and timing events. all you do
is create the splashscreen mega widget, populate it as you see fit, then
invoke splash() to display it and destroy() to tear it down.
