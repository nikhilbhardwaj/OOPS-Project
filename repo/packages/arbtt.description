Automatic rule-based time tracker
	
the program arbtt, the automatic rule-based time tracker, allows you to
investigate how you spend your time, without having to manually specify what
you are doing. arbtt records what windows are open and active, and provides
you with a powerful rule-based language to afterwards categorize your work.
