Stretch functions for simple directmedia layer
	
this library provides stretch and blit routines for sdl surfaces.
these are optimized for speed including lots of assembler parts
in the general routines and dynamic cpu native code generation
for applications to compile specialized stretch-and-blit routines
at runtime.

this package contains the sdl_stretch runtime library.
