Module to obtain filesystem disk space information
	
this module provides a way to obtain filesystem disk space
information. this is a unix only distribution. if you want to gather
this information for unix and windows, use filesys::dfportable.  the
only major benefit of using filesys::df over filesys::dfportable, is
that filesys::df supports the use of open filehandles as arguments.
