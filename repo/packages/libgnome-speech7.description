Gnome text-to-speech library
	
the gnome speech library gives a simple yet general api for programs
to convert text into speech, as well as speech input.

multiple backends are supported by the gnome speech library.
the festival and espeak backends are provided by default in this package;
other backends that require prorietary software are available via separate
packages (gnome-speech-dectalk, gnome-speech-ibmtts and gnome-speech-swift).
