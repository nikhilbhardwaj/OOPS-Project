Xml-based report generator for php
	
a common business need is the ability to generate reports dynamically from
an sql database and present the information in a tabular fashion.
phpreports takes an xml definition of the general layout of the report and a
query, and produces a finished report in one of several formats.

phpreports is both a useful report generation package, as well as an
excellent demonstration of the power of xml/xslt.
