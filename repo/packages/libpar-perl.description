Perl redistributable module packaging framework
	
par is a perl framework which allows you to easily bundle a typical blib/
tree into a compressed file (currently a zip) called a perl archive. this
makes it fairly simple to redistribute, even providing support for loading
c/xs modules by overriding dynaloader's bootstrapping methods. it writes a
shared object file to a temporary file at the time it is needed.
