Store and restore metadata from a filesystem
	
metastore is a tool to store the metadata of files/directories/links in a file
tree to a separate file and to later compare and apply the stored metadata to
said file tree.

the tool was written as a supplement to git which does not store all metadata,
making it unsuitable for e.g. storing /etc in a repo. metastore could also be
helpful if you want to create a tarball of a file tree and make sure that
"everything" (e.g. xattrs, mtime, owner, group) is stored along with the files.
