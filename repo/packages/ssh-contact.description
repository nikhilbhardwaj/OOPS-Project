Establish ssh connections to your im contacts using telepathy (metapackage)
	
ssh-contact is a client/service tool that makes easy to connect your telepathy
im contacts via ssh. no need to care about dynamic ip, nat, port forwarding
or firewalls anymore; if you can chat with a friend, you can also ssh him.

this package is a metapackage that depends on both ssh-contact-client and
ssh-contact-service.
