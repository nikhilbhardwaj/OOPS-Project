Development library for scim platform
	
scim (smart common input method) is an input method (im) platform.

this package provides development libraries on scim platform, including the
header files and static libraries.  the development documentations can be
found in the scim-dev-doc package.

scim can be used as a dynamically loaded library on a single machine, or as a
server/client model through socket in a network environment.  as a component
of the system, scim can work with existing im framework such as xim or iiimf
(in progress), as well as using client specific im interface, such as gtk+
im module or qt im module.  scim provides an im application, scim, which use
various im engines to provide input methods for many languages, either by
native modules (such as scim-pinyin and scim-hangul) or interfaces to other
im libraries (such as scim-anthy, scim-uim, scim-m17n, and scim-chewing).
