Fast and simple snmp scanner
	
onesixtyone is a simple snmp scanner which sends snmp requests for the
sysdescr value asynchronously with user-adjustable sending times and
then logs the responses which gives the description of the software
running on the device.

running onesixtyone on a class b network (switched 100mbs with 1gbs
backbone) with -w 10 gives a performance of 3 seconds per class c, with
no dropped packets, and all 65536 ip addresses were scanned in less than
13 minutes.
