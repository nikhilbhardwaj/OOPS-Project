Development files for the libmthca driver
	
libmthca is a device-specific driver for mellanox infiniband host
channel adapters (hcas) for the libibverbs library.  this allows
userspace processes to access mellanox hca hardware directly with
low latency and low overhead.

this package contains static versions of libmthca that may be linked
directly to an application, which may be useful for debugging.
