Module for flexible printf-like string formatting
	
string::format is a perl module that allows developers to define arbitrary
printf-like format sequences to be expanded, inspired by mutt's index_format
and related directives. this module would be most useful in configuration
files and reporting tools, where the results of a query need to be formatted
in a particular way.
