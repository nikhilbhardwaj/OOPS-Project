Openhpi daemon, supports gathering of manageability information
	
openhpi is an implementation of the service availability forum's hardware
platform interface specification.  (see http://www.saforum.org)  as
such, openhpi facilitates the development of computer manageability
applications which are not tied to a single hardware vendor's products.

this package contains the openhpi daemon.  this process gathers
information from managed hardware and systems, making this available
to openhpi-based applications.
