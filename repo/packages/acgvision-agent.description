Monitoring client for acgvision.
	
acgvision is a client/server monitoring system. it is made of 4 parts:

 - acgvision-core is the server. it serves jobs to agents, computes
   information to display on the console and sends email about events.
 - acgvision-agent is the client. it monitors the system activity.
 - acgvision-console is a joomla plugin displaying reports about
   activity and allows selecting monitoring jobs for each agent.
 - acgvision-parameter is the gui for creating jobs and templates (services)
   for acgvision.


acgvision-agent is the client used by acgvision to monitor the system
activity. it can monitor cpu activity, memory, filesystem space, and
processes. it is controlled by the acgvision server (like what to monitor,
which commands to execute and when to execute them).

it checks the result and compares it to event values. if the value matches
some criterias it sends an event to the core which will email it to the host
owner and its followers. the event will also be displayed on the web console.

the client exchanges soap messages with the server via http or https. it
reports events and executes scripts on failure. it is compatible with many
nagios scripts.
