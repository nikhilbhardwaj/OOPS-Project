X11 based cd player
	
xmcd uses the motif toolkit (using the free lesstif libraries) to achieve a
pleasing appearance, such that it actually looks and feels like a real cd
player for all basic functions, yet takes advantage of the gui and window
system to make programming and cd database functions easy.
