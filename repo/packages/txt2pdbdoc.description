Convert plain text files to palm doc (for palmos) and back
	
this utility converts plain text files (or html files) to the de facto
palmos standard doc format for use in document readers (such as "c spot
run") and editors (such as "zdoc").  doc files are compressed by
default, and txt2pdbdoc can also convert doc files back to plain text.
