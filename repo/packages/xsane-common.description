Featureful graphical frontend for sane (scanner access now easy)
	
xsane can be run as a stand-alone program or through the gimp image
manipulation program.  in stand-alone mode, xsane can save an image
to a file in a variety of image formats, serve as a frontend to a
fax program, or send an image to a printer.

this package contains architecture-independent files needed by xsane
(locales, help).
