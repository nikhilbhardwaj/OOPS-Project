Literate programming tool for objective caml
	
literate programming, as defined by knuth, means to combine program
code and documentation into one source document from which program
code and documentation can be extracted. the approach of ocamlweb is
that documentation is to be included in the program code as special
comments. the ocamlweb tool extracts from this the documented program
code as latex document, while no special preprocessing is required to
compile the source files.
