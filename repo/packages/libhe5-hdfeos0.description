Earth observation system extensions to hdf5
	
hdf-eos5 is a software library designed built on hdf5 to support eos-specific
data structures, namely grid, point, and swath. the new data structures
are constructed from standard hdf data objects, using eos conventions, through
the use of a software library [1,4]. a key feature of hdf-eos files is that
instrument-independent services, such as subsetting by geolocation, can be
applied to the files across a wide variety of data products.
the library is extensible and new data structures can be added.
