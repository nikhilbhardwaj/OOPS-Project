Extension of the python threading api
	
this is an extension to the basic python threading library. it allows
inheritance of locks and several other non-inheritable types. it also
adds a few new lock types for those who found the original set
lacking.

its main characteristics are:


 * subclassable locks
 * read/write mode lock (write locks are exclusive, read locks are
   not)
 * "safe" object based locks to help debug lock code.
