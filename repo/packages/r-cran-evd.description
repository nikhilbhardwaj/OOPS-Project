Gnu r functions for extreme value distributions
	
extends simulation, distribution, quantile and density functions to
univariate and multivariate parametric extreme value distributions, and
provides fitting functions which calculate maximum likelihood estimates
for univariate and bivariate maxima models, and for univariate and
bivariate threshold models.
