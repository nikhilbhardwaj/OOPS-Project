Network performance measurement tool
	
nuttcp is a network performance measurement tool intended for use by network
and system managers. its most basic usage is to determine the raw tcp (or udp)
network layer throughput by transferring memory buffers from a source system
across an interconnecting network to a destination system, either transferring
data for a specified time interval, or alternatively transferring a specified
number of bytes.
