Compile native-code modules for python from python-like syntax
	
pyrex lets you write code that mixes python and c data types any way you want,
and compiles it into a c extension for python.

you can get very large speedups for tasks that don't need all the dynamic
features of python, with very small differences in syntax and much less
hassle than writing your modules from scratch in c.
