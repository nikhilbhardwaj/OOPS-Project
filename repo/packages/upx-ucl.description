An efficient live-compressor for executables
	
upx is an advanced executable file compressor. upx will typically
reduce the file size of programs and dlls by around 50%-70%, thus
reducing disk space, network load times, download times etc. the
current version can compress executables for dos, linux/elf (i386,
amd64, ppc32) and some other files for different os.

note: this package is based on the ucl library, which is licensed under gpl.
