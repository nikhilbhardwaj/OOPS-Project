Utility for mp3 wrapping (rolling multiple mp3s into one)
	
command-line utility that wraps multiple mp3 files into a single, playable
mp3, without losing filenames or id3 information, and without reencoding. also
supports archiving non-audio data such as playlists, info files, and cover
images inside the mp3. these files can be unpacked later (using mp3splt, e.g.);
ordinary mp3 decoders can play the entire audio stream as one long track.

this is a free, independent alternative to albumwrap:
