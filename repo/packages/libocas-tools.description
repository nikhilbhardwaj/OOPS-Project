Standalone applications implementing the ocas solver
	
this library implements optimized cutting plane algorithm (ocas) for
training linear support vector machine (svm) classifiers from
large-scale data. the computational effort of ocas scales linearly with
the number of training examples. it is one of the fastest svm solvers
around for solving linear and multiclass l2 regularized svms.

this package contains the standalone applications.
