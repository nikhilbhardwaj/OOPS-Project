Tiny and flexible webcam program
	
fswebcam is a tiny and flexible webcam command-line program for capturing
images from a v4l1/v4l2 device. it accepts a number of formats, can skip
the first (possibly bad) frames before performing the actual capture, and
can perform simple manipulation on the captured image, such as resizing,
averaging multiple frames or overlaying a caption or an image.
