Library of optimized inner loops (development headers)
	
liboil is a collection of functions that often benefit from having
special implementations on various architectures or cpus.  each function
in liboil has several implementations which may perform faster or
slower on a given cpu.  some implementations use alternate algorithms,
some use hand-crafted assembly, and some use special instructions that
are only available on certain cpus, such as mmx, sse, or altivec.
the fastest implementation is automatically chosen at runtime.

this package contains the development headers and libraries, and should
be installed to compile software that uses liboil.
