Perl module to manage an imap account
	
net::imap::simple provides a simple way to access and manipulate information
on internet message access protocol (imap) capable servers. the api is mostly
equivalent to net::pop3, with some additional extensions based on the other
features supported in the imap standard. this module supports connections via
ssl using io::socket::ssl (see libio-socket-ssl-perl), over ipv6 using
io::socket::inet6 (see libio-socket-inet6-perl) and handling messages in
various ways (delete or undelete, mark as read or unread, expunge, edit
flags, and more).
