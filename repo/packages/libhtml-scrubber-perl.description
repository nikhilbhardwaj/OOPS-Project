Perl extension for scrubbing/sanitizing html
	
if you want to "scrub" or "sanitize" html input in a reliable and
flexible fashion, then this module is for you.

the author says: "i was not satisfied with html::sanitizer because it
is based on html::treebuilder, so i thought i would write something
similar that works directly with html::parser".
