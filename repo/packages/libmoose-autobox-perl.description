Perl autobox wrapper that understands moose roles
	
moose::autobox implements scalar, array, hash and code handlers for use with
autobox, which is a perl pragma facilitating method calls on native perl data
types. this module understands the hierarchy of roles and provides support for
data manipulation in a manner similar to what perl 6 might do.
