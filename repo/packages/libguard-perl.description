Perl module providing safe cleanup using guard objects
	
guard is a perl module implementing so-called "guards," which are things that
"guard" a resource, ensuring that it is safely cleaned up when expected, even
if exceptional conditions interrupt the normal control flow. this allows one
to write code which executes an arbitrary code block or subroutine when either
the related guard object is destroyed or when the current scope ends. in other
languages, this sort of functionality is provided by the 'finally' keyword.
