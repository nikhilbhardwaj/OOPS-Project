Haskell support for xml in source code - ghc 6 libraries
	
hsx (haskell source with xml) allows literal xml syntax to be used in
haskell source code. the trhsx preprocessor translates .hsx source files
into ordinary .hs files. literal xml syntax is translated into function
calls for creating xml values of the appropriate forms. trhsx transforms
literal xml syntax into a series of function calls.

this package contains the libraries compiled for ghc 6.
