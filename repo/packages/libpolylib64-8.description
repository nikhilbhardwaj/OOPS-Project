The polyhedral library - long int version
	
polylib is a free c library for doing computations on polyhedra.
the library is operating on objects like vectors, matrices, lattices,
polyhedra, z-polyhedra, unions of polyhedra and other intermediary
structures.
it provides functions for all important operations on these structures.
this package provides the version for operations on long integers.
