Strongswan daemon starter and configuration file parser
	
strongswan is an ipsec-based vpn solution for the linux kernel. it uses the
native ipsec stack and runs on any recent 2.6 kernel (no patching required).
it supports both ikev1 and the newer ikev2 protocols.

the starter and the associated "ipsec" script control both pluto and charon
from the command line. it parses ipsec.conf and loads the configurations to
the daemons. while the ikev2 daemon can use other configuration backends, the
ikev1 daemon is limited to configurations from ipsec.conf.
