Graphical tool for merging and comparing text files
	
diffuse is a graphical tool for merging and comparing text files. diffuse is
able to compare an arbitrary number of files side-by-side and gives users the
ability to manually adjust line-matching and directly edit files. diffuse can
also retrieve revisions of files from bazaar, cvs, darcs, git, mercurial,
monotone, subversion and gnu revision control system (rcs) repositories for
comparison and merging.
