Helper module to use perl xs with c++ code
	
extutils::xspp is a perl module that implements xs++, which is a thin layer
on top of plain xs for supporting c++ code. it allows developers to easily
write perl bindings to c++ code by compiling code using the xs++ preprocessor
`xspp' instead of the normal xs preprocessor `xsubpp'.
