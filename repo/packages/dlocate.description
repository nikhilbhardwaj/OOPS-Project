Fast alternative to dpkg -l and dpkg -s
	
uses gnu grep and text dumps of dpkg's data to greatly speed up finding out which
package a file belongs to (i.e. a very fast dpkg -s). many other uses,
including options to view all files in a package, calculate disk space
used, view and check md5sums, list man pages, etc.
