Library implementing support vector machines
	
the libsvm library is used to calculate support vector machine optimizations
with a great variety of powerful options.  it includes one-class, two-class,
multiclass, regression-mode, and probablistic output functionality.  it is
primarily of interest to machine-learning researchers and artificial
intelligence application developers.
