Gui for gnu arch
	
archway is a gnu arch gui.  it follows the unix tradition of small tools
doing their work well and cooperating nicely with each other.

some tips: in a working tree, run "archelf" to operate on project files;
run "archmag" to manage tree merges; run "archeye ." to view tree changes;
run "archeye ,undo-1" to view any changeset; run "archrog" to manage
registered archives; and so on.

alternativelly, just run "archway" and choose the desired tools from there.
