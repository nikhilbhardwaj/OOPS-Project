A monospaced, sans-serif font
	
this font was originally inspired by work i was doing on a monospace kayah
li range (a burmese minority script). as i continued to work on it, the
latin letters assumed more and more of a "swiss" feel, so i named the font
after the jura region  on the border between france and switzerland.

almost all of the latin-1 range is represented (omitting only superscript
numerals, fractions, and the pilcrow).
