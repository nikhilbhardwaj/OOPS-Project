Converts documents from latex to rtf - documentation
	
attempts to convert as much formatting information as possible from
latex to microsoft's rich text format (rtf).  while rtf has limited
support for mathematical markup, it is widely supported as a "least
common denominator" word processing format.

this package includes the documentation for latex2rtf in html, info
and pdf formats.
