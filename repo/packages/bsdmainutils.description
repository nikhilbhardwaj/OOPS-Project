this package contains lots of small programs many people expect to find when
they use a bsd-style unix system.

it provides banner (as printerbanner), calendar, col, colcrt, colrm, column,
from (as bsd-from), hexdump (or hd), look, lorder, ncal (or cal), ul, and
write (as bsd-write).

this package used to contain whois and vacation, which are now distributed in
their own packages. also here was tsort, which is now in the "coreutils"
package.
