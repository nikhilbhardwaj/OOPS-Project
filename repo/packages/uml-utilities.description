User-mode linux (utility programs)
	
user-mode linux is a port of the linux kernel to its own system call
interface.  it provides a kind of virtual machine, which runs linux
as a user process under another linux kernel.  this is useful for
kernel development, sandboxing, jailing, experimentation, and
many other things.

this package contains userspace utilities for use with user-mode
linux, including uml_mconsole, uml_moo, uml_switch, uml_net and
tunctl.
