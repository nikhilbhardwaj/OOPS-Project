Attractive desktop clock
	
as clocks go, buici satisfies the basic need of representing the
time accurately and attractively.  i wrote it when i began to use x
as my primary desktop environment and wanted to have a decent
looking clock on my desktop.  i loathe digital clocks. this release
has limited configurability.
