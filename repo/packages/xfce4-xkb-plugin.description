Xkb layout switch plugin for the xfce4 panel
	
the xkb plugin shows you the current keyboard layout and allows you to
switch to different defined layouts.

the plugin itself cannot be used for defining the keyboard
layouts one wants to use, this is done the xkb way - either
in your x config or by setxkbmap tool.
