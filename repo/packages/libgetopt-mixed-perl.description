Perl module for processing options in gnu-style (= long and short)
	
this module is intended to be the "getopt-to-end-all-getop's".  it
combines flexibility and simplicity.  it supports both short options
(introduced by `-') and long options (introduced by `--').  short
options which do not take an argument can be grouped together.  short
options which do take an argument must be the last option in their
group, because everything following the option will be considered to
be its argument.
