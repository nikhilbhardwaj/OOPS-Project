Remotely determine dns server version
	
a nameserver basically responds to a query. interoperability is an
obvious requirement here. the standard protocol behaviour of different
dns implementations is expected to be the same.

the reality is quite different though. fpdns uses a series of borderline
dns queries to determine the vendor, product and version of a nameserver.
