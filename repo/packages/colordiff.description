Tool to colorize 'diff' output
	
colordiff is a wrapper for the 'diff' command. it produces
the same output as diff, but with colored highlighting to improve
readability. the color schemes can be customized.

the output is similar to the syntax-highlighting mode of vim or emacs
when editing a patch created by diff.
