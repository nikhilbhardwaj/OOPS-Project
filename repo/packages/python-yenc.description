Yenc encoding/decoding extension for python
	
the yenc module provide a simple api for doing raw encoding/decoding of
yencoded binaries, mainly for retrieving or posting to the usenet.
this implementation is really simple and intended mainly as an exercise
to the author but is also significatively faster than any possible pure
python implementation and it's being actually used by some python nntp
clients out there.
