Module to use either moose or mouse, based on availability
	
any::moose is a perl module that intelligently loads either moose or mouse,
which provide nearly identical interfaces to the same modern object system.
this module takes advantage of the fact that anything that works with mouse
should also work with moose.

note that using this module may not always be appropriate because mouse is a
lightweight implementation of the moose object system, which trades some of
the less-used functionality for increased performance.
