Automate interaction with websites (ruby 1.8)
	
the www::mechanize library is used for automating interaction with websites.
mechanize automatically stores and sends cookies, follows redirects, can
follow links, and submit forms. form fields can be populated and submitted.
mechanize also keeps track of the sites that you have visited as a history.
this library is loosely based on www::mechanize for perl.

this package is built for ruby 1.8.
