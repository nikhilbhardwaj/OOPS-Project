Userspace layer 7 packet classifier
	
this is a version of l7-filter, an application layer packet classifier,
that works in userspace instead of the kernel.  it is eventually intended to
replace the kernel version since running in userspace is much safer and more
flexible. however, it is in the early stages of development and not yet ready
for prime time.
