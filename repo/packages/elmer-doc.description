Elmer multiphysics fea package documentation
	
the elmer open source mutiphysics simulation package includes physical models
of fluid dynamics, structural mechanics, electromagnetics, heat transfer and
acoustics, among others. these are described by partial differential equations
which elmer solves by the finite element method (fem).

this package contains the non-free elmer pdf documentation files.
