Gettext plugin enabling internationalization in smarty
	
smarty gettext is a smarty plugin providing internationalization support
based on the standard gettext mechanism. smarty is a popular php templating
engine.

you need the php command line interpreter if you wish to use the tsmarty2c
program: it lets you extract localizable strings from a smarty template so
that you can use the normal gettext tools afterwards.
