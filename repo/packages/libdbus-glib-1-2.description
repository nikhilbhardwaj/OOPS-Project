Simple interprocess messaging system (glib-based shared library)
	
d-bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and corba in
terms of complexity.

this package provides the glib-based shared library for applications using the
glib interface to d-bus.

see the dbus description for more information about d-bus in general.
