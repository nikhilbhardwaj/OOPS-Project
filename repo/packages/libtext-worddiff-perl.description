Track changes between documents
	
this module is a variation on the lovely text::diff module. rather than
generating traditional line-oriented diffs, however, it generates
word-oriented diffs. this can be useful for tracking changes in
narrative documents or documents with very long lines. to diff source
code, one is still best off using text::diff. but if you want to see how
a short story changed from one version to the next, this module will do
the job very nicely.
