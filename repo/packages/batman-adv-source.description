Source for the batman-advanced kernel module
	
this package provides the source code for the batman-adv-source kernel modules.
kernel source or headers are required to compile these modules.

b.a.t.m.a.n. (better approach to mobile ad-hoc networking) is a new routing
protocol for multi-hop ad-hoc mesh networks. b.a.t.m.a.n.-advanced is the
implementation of this protocol on iso/osi layer 2, allowing mesh networks to
be used as a virtual switch. with this approach, lans and wans can be easily
integrated, and more protocols (like dhcp, ipv6) are supported.
