Open-source version of sgi's audiofile library
	
the audiofile library allows the processing of audio data to and from audio
files of many common formats (currently aiff, aiff-c, wave, next/sun, bics,
and raw data).

this package contains debugging symbols for the audiofile shared library.
tools like gdb and ltrace make use of these symbols.
