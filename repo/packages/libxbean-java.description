Plugin based java application server
	
the goal of xbean project is to created a plugin based server analogous to
eclipse being a plugin based ide. xbean will be able to discover, download and
install server plugins from an internet based repository. in addition, we
include support for multiple ioc systems, support for running with no ioc
system, jmx without jmx code, lifecycle and class loader management, and a rock
solid spring integration.
