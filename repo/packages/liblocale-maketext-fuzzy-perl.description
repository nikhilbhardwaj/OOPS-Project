Maketext from already interpolated strings
	
this module is a subclass of locale::maketext, with additional
support for localizing messages that already contains interpolated
variables.  this is most useful when the messages are returned by
external modules -- for example, to match "dir: command not found"
against "[_1]: command not found".
