Small dns proxy that supports ipv6/ipv4 record translation
	
totd is a small dns proxy nameserver which supports ipv6 and enable ipv6
only sites to access ipv4 sites by using some translation mechanism such
as nat-pt, kame faith, etc...

you can also use totd as local dns proxy server. it is convenient for some
applications which call res_init(3) only once. these application cannot
search new dns server when resolv.conf is changed by dhcp or ppp. totd
enables you to query dns record to new dns servers without restarting them.
