Dispatch notifications using php callbacks
	
the event_dispatcher acts as a notification dispatch table. it is used to
notify other objects of interesting things. this information is encapsulated
in event_notification objects. client objects register themselves with the
event_dispatcher as observers of specific notifications posted by other
objects. when an event occurs, an object posts an appropriate notification to
the event_dispatcher. the event_dispatcher dispatches a message to each
registered observer, passing the notification as the sole argument.
