Linux containers userspace tools
	
containers are insulated areas inside a system, which have their own namespace
for filesystem, network, pids, ipc, cpu and memory allocation and which can be
created using the control group and namespace features included in recent linux
kernels.

this package contains the lxc-* tools which can be used to start a single
daemon in a container, or to boot an entire "containerized" system, and to
successively manage and debug your containers.
