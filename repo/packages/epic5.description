Epic irc client, version 5
	
epic5 is an irc client based on ircii.  it is primarily suited to users who
wish to write their own irc scripts or have irc scripts written by others.

previous versions of epic were 100% compatible with ircii 2.8.2, though
this is no longer the case.  instead we've taken a new direction and chosen
to find places where compatibility with ircii is undesirable and fix them.
no gratuitous incompatibilities have been added, though many new features
have been.
