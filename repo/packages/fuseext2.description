File system in user space - module for ext2
	
this module for the fuse kernel service allows any fuse-enabled user to mount
second extended file systems, e.g. disk images.

the module has been initially written for umview, the user-mode
implementation of view-os. if you want to allow completely user-mode disk
images mounting (with no kernel/superuser support at all), take a look at
umview-mod-umfuseext2 and its dependencies.
