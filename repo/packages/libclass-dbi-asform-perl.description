Module to produce html form elements for database columns using class::dbi
	
the class::dbi::asform module helps to generate html forms for creating new
database rows or editing existing rows. it maps column names in a database
table to html form elements which fit the schema. large text fields
are turned into textareas, and fields with a has-a relationship to
other class::dbi tables are turned into select drop-downs populated
with objects from the joined class.
