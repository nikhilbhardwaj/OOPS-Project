Library providing read access on zip-archives - development
	
the zziplib library is intentionally lightweight, it offers the ability
to easily extract data from files archived in a single zip file.
applications can bundle files into a single zip archive and access them.
the implementation is based only on the (free) subset of compression
with the zlib algorithm which is actually used by the zip/unzip tools.

this package contains the header files and static library needed to
compile applications that use zziplib.
