Perl module for parsing xml files node based
	
the xml::node module allows you to register callback functions or variables
for any xml node.  if you register a call back function, it will be
called when the node of the type you specified are encountered.  if
you register a variable, the content of an xml node will be appended
to that variable automatically.
