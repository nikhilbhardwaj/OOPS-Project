Simple page-prefetch for squid web proxy
	
squid-prefetch will perform early fetches of pages linked to by pages already
read.  this means that a user that clicks on a link will have that new page
appear instantly instead of having to wait for it to be fetched from the
internet.  only text pages are prefetched on the assumption that the images
can be loaded later so long as the text of a page is available for display.
