A preprocessor for musixtex
	
pmx is a preprocessor for musixtex that produces near-publication
quality scores and parts with far less effort than would
be required using musixtex alone.

among the new features are several that facilitate detailed editing,
for example fine-tuning positions of dots, ornaments, and xtuplet
numbers.  it now also generates midi output!
