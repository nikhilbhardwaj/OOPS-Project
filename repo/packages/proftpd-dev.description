Versatile, virtual-hosting ftp daemon - development files
	
proftpd is a powerful replacement for wu-ftpd. this file transfer protocol
daemon supports hidden directories, virtual hosts, and per-directory
".ftpaccess" files. it uses a single main configuration file, with a
syntax similar to apache.

because of the advanced design, anonymous-ftp directories can have
an arbitrary internal structure (bin, lib, etc, and special files are
not needed). advanced features such as multiple password files and
upload/download ratios are also supported.

this package contains all files required to develop thirdr-parties
modules that can be loaded at run-time by means of dso support.
