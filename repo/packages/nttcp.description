New test tcp program
	
this program is a much more convenient version of the ttcp program.
it uses inetd (or simulates its behaviour) to start off the remote
side program which will send/receive data. both sides measure the time
and number of bytes transfered. the local side will print the measures.
the format of the output can be specified on the commandline.
