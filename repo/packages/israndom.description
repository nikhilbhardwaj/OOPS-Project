Nonclassical randomness test using data compressors
	
israndom tests a sequence of symbols for randomness.  israndom tries to
determine if a given sequence of trials could reasonably be assumed  to
be  from  a  random  uniform distribution over a fixed-size alphabet of
2-256 symbols.  it uses mathematical results from kolmogorov complexity
theory and shannon entropy (in classical information theory) in order to
determine if a given sequence is effectively random or not.  it does this
by bounding the kolmogorov complexity function from above using compressors.
