Transitional package for webauth development files
	
webauth is a cookie-based web authentication system built on top of
kerberos.  it relies on a central authentication server that handles all
user authentication for a domain and creates user authentication
credentials for any web server that needs strong authentication.

this is a transitional package to assist upgrades to the current webauth
development package.  it can be removed from your system after
installation.
