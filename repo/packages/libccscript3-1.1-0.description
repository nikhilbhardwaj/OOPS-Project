Gnu common c++ framework for embedded scripting
	
the gnu ccscript package offers a class extensible threaded embedded
scripting engine for use with gnu common c++.  this engine is also used in
gnu bayonne (the gnu telephony application server package) and other
parts of gnucomm (the gnu telephony meta-project). this engine differs
from traditional scripting systems in that it is used to script near
real-time state-event systems through deterministic callback step
execution rather than the linear and non-deterministic fashion of embedded
script systems such as tcl, libguile, etc.
