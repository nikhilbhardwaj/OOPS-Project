Software pcl emulation for canon capsl laser printers
	
cjet filters printer data from stdin to stdout, converting hp pcl
(printer command language) escape sequences and data structures,
e.g. font headers, to their capsl equivalents.

the only printers known to use this language are the canon lbp-4u and
canon lbp-8a1.
