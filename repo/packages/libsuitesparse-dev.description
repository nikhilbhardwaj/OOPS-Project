Libraries for sparse matrices computations (development files)
	
suitesparse is a collection of libraries for computations involving
sparse matrices.  this package includes the following libraries:

amd         approximate minimum degree ordering

camd        symmetric approximate minimum degree

btf         permutation to block triangular form (beta)

colamd      column approximate minimum degree ordering

ccolamd     constrained column approximate minimum degree ordering

cholmod     sparse cholesky factorization

csparse     a concise sparse matrix package

cxsparse    csparse extended: complex matrix, int and long int support

klu         sparse lu factorization, primarily for circuit simulation

ldl         a simple ldl' factorization

umfpack     sparse lu factorization

this package contains the static libraries and header files.
