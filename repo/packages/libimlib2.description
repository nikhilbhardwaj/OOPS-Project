Powerful image loading and rendering library
	
imlib2 is an advanced replacement for libraries like libxpm.
imlib2 provides many more features with much greater flexibility
and speed than standard libraries, including font rasterization,
rotation, rgba space rendering and blending, dynamic binary
filters, scripting, and more.

imlib2 is not a drop-in replacement for imlib 1.x.
