Module for sending and receiving ipv4 and ipv6 multicast messages
	
the io::socket::multicast6 module subclasses io::socket::inet6 to enable you
to manipulate multicast groups. with this module you will be able to receive
incoming multicast transmissions and generate your own outgoing multicast
packets.

io::socket::multicast6 uses the same api as io::socket::multicast, but with
added support for ipv6 (ipv4 is still supported). unlike
io::socket::multicast, this is a pure-perl module.
