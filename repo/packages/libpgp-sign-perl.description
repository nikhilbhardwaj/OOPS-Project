Perl module to create detached pgp signatures
	
creates and checks detached pgp signatures for textual data using gnupg.
other pgp implementations are also supported with run-time configuration.
secret key passphrases are passed via a pipe, and no temporary files are
required for signature generation (but are for signature verification).
