The ktexteditor interfaces for the kde platform
	
this package provides the ktexteditor interfaces (also called kte interfaces)
that are a set of well-defined interfaces which an application or library can
implement to provide advanced plain text editing services. applications which
utilise this interface can thus allow the user to choose which implementation
of the editor component to use. the only implementation right now is the kate
editor component (kate part).

this package is part of the kde development platform libraries module.
