Mpi parallel computing system implementation
	
mpich is a robust and flexible implementation of the mpi (message passing
interface).  mpi is often used with parallel or distributed computing
projects.  mpich is a multi-platform, configurable system (development,
execution, libraries, etc) for mpi.  it can achieve parallelism using
networked machines or using multitasking on a single machine.

this version is compiled with ch_p4 support, which only requires installation
on the master node, and starts up parallel tasks using rsh.
