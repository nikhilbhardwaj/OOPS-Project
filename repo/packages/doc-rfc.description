Rfc documents metapackage
	
rfc (request for comments) documents are a series of technical and
organizational notes about the internet. they are edited by the
internet engineering task force (ietf).

this is a metapackage that pulls in the new doc-rfc-xxx packages
(those that most closely correspond to the old doc-rfc package).

it can be removed if users want just a subset of the rfcs.
