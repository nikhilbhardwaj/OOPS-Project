Vnc java applet and command line program
	
vnc stands for virtual network computing. it is, in essence, a remote
display system which allows you to view a computing `desktop' environment
not only on the machine where it is running, but from anywhere on the
internet and from a wide variety of machine architectures.

this is the vnc java applet files that the vnc-server
can distribute to the client.

it also includes the tightvnc patches from http://www.tightvnc.com/
