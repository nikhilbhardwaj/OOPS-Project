Instrument editor for gigasampler files
	
gigedit is an instrument editor allowing to modify existing gigasampler
files, as well as creating new ones from scratch. the gui is based on
the gtk+ (gtkmm) toolkit. even though it is created as a subproject of
the linuxsampler project, it is currently a completely independent
stand-alone editor.
