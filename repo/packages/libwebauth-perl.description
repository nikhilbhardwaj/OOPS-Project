Perl library for webauth authentication
	
webauth is a cookie-based web authentication system built on top of
kerberos.  it relies on a central authentication server that handles all
user authentication for a domain and creates user authentication
credentials for any web server that needs strong authentication.

this package contains the perl bindings to the webauth library, which
does token encoding and decoding and other lower-level parts of the
webauth protocol.
