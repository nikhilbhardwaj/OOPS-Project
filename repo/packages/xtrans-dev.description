X transport library (development files)
	
xtrans includes a number of routines to make x implementations
transport-independent; at time of writing, it includes support for unix
sockets, ipv4, ipv6, and decnet.

xtrans is not actually a library in itself; it includes .c files which are
then used in the compilation of x servers, libraries, et al.
