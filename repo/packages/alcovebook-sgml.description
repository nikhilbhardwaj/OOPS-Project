Alcove customisation of the docbook dtd and stylesheets
	
this includes the alcovebook dtd (generic, still to be refined into several
other dtds), and the alcove dsssl stylesheets, which currently include:

 - a generic extension over norman walsh's modular stylesheets
 - a book-like style for article
 - an improved article style (still somewhat experimental)


it integrates smoothly within the sgml2x framework.
