Brute force binary tester
	
bfbtester is great for doing quick, proactive, security checks of
binary programs. bfbtester will perform checks of single and multiple
argument command line overflows as well as environment variable
overflows. bfbtester can also watch for tempfile creation activity to
alert the user of any programs using unsafe tempfile names. while
bfbtester can not test all overflows in software, it is useful for
detecting initial mistakes that can red flag dangerous software.
