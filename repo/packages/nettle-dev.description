Low level cryptographic library (development files)
	
nettle is a cryptographic library that is designed to fit easily in more or
less any context: in crypto toolkits for object-oriented languages (c++,
python, pike, ...), in applications like lsh or gnupg, or even in kernel
space.

it tries to solve a problem of providing a common set of cryptographic
algorithms for higher-level applications by implementing a
context-independent set of cryptographic algorithms. in that light, nettle
doesn't do any memory allocation or i/o, it simply provides the
cryptographic algorithms for the application to use in any environment and
in any way it needs.

this package contains the development files (c headers and static libraries)
