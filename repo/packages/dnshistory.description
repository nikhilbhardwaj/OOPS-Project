Translating and storing of ip addresses from log files
	
provide a means for storing a history of dns/name changes for the ip addresses
extracted from web log files. the major target being that multiple analyses of
older log files do not require re-lookups of ip address to fqdns, and
additionally maintain the accuracy of the lookup as it was then and not as it
is now.
