Perl module to load plugins in a specified order
	
module::pluggable::ordered is a perl module which extends the functionality
provided by module::pluggable, allowing hooks to determine an ordering for
modules to be loaded, producing an effect like the system v init process,
where files can specify where in the init sequence they'd like to be called.
