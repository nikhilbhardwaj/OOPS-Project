Terminal emulator widget for gtk+ 2.0 - runtime files
	
the vte library inserts terminal capability strings into a trie, and then
uses it to determine if data received from a pseudo-terminal is a control
sequence or just random data. the sample program "interpret" illustrates
more or less what the widget sees after it filters incoming data.
