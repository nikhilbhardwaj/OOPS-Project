A cascading style sheets (css) editing mode for emacs
	
this is a simple emacs mode for editing css style sheets. it adds
font-locking and some basic auto-indentation support to emacs. it
works with emacs 19.34, but should also work with both older and
newer versions as well as xemacs.

while css has a c-like syntax, this mode does a better job than
cc-mode of handling the features of the css language.  it supports
both css level 1 and level 2.
