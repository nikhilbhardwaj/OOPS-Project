Dump perl data structures into javascript code
	
data::javascript is mainly inteded for cgi programming, when a perl script
generates a page with client side javascript code that needs access to
structures created on the server.

it works by creating one line of javascript code per datum. therefore,
structures cannot be created anonymously and need to be assigned to
variables. however, this format enables dumping large structures.
