Multi-threading poller for cacti
	
spine (formerly cactid) is an experimental replacement for the default
cmd.php poller in the cacti package.  it primarily strives to be as fast as
possible, and is designed for sites with large numbers of hosts
and devices polled.

if the default poller provided by cacti works for you, then you should
not use this package.  you should only use this package if the default
poller is unable to complete a polling cycle in the required amount
of time.
