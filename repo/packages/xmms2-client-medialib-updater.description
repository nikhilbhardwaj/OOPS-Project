Xmms2 - medialib-updater client
	
the media library is where xmms2 stores metadata about files as it plays them.
having a media library allows xmms2 to 'remember' the songs it has played, and
thus allows users to easily re-create their favorite playlists.

this package contains the medialib-updater client which monitors given
directories and updates the media library with new and changed files.
