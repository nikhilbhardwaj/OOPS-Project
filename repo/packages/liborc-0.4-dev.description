Library of optimized inner loops runtime compiler (development headers)
	
orc is a library and set of tools for compiling and executing
very simple programs that operate on arrays of data.  the "language"
is a generic assembly language that represents many of the features
available in simd architectures, including saturated addition and
subtraction, and many arithmetic operations.

this package contains the development headers and libraries, and should
be installed to compile software that uses orc.
