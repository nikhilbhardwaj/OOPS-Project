The gambas sqlite3 driver database component
	
gambas is a programming language based on a basic interpreter with
object extensions - like visual basic, though it is not a clone!
it has many components for developing internationalized,
desktop-independent, database- and network-enabled applications.
even games can be developed very quickly using its rad environment.

this component allows you to access to sqlite3 databases (not for sqlite 2,
there is another package for sqlite 2) from gambas code.
