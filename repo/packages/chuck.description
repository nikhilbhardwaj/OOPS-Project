Concurrent, on-the-fly audio programming language
	
chuck is a new audio programming language for real-time synthesis,
composition, and performance, which runs on commodity operating systems.

chuck presents a new time-based concurrent programming model, which supports
multiple, simultaneous, dynamic control rates, and the ability to add, remove,
and modify code, on-the-fly, while the program is running, without stopping or
restarting.
