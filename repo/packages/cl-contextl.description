Context orientation for common lisp
	
contextl provides the common lisp object system with functionality
for context orientation. it allows the definition of context-specific
methods or class slots, so that methods act differently depending on
the dynamic context they are executed in.

it further allows developers to rebind places (e.g. slots of objects)
dynamically using the "dletf" framework that has previously been
present in aspectl.
