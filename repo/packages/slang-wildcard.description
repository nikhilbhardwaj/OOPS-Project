Adds a wildcard match function to s-lang
	
the s-lang module contained in this package provides a
wildcard_match() function to s-lang. it's vectorized, so it should be
faster than an array_map(&string_match, ... ).  this module can be
used in slsh (the s-lang shell), in the jed editor, and in the news
reader slrn.
