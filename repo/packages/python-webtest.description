Wraps any wsgi application and makes it easy to test
	
webtest helps you test your wsgi-based web applications. this can be any
application that has a wsgi (web server gateway interface) interface,
including an application written in a framework that supports wsgi (which
includes most actively developed python web frameworks â€“ almost anything
that even nominally supports wsgi should be testable).
