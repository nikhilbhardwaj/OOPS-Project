Gives a fake root environment
	
this package is intended to enable something like:

  dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot

i.e. to remove the need to become root for a package build.
this is done by setting ld_preload to libfakeroot.so,
which provides wrappers around getuid, chown, chmod, mknod,
stat, and so on, thereby creating a fake root environment.

fakeroot requires sysv ipc or tcp to operate.
