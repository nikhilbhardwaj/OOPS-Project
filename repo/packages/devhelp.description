A gnome developers help program
	
devhelp's primary goal is to be an api documentation browser for gnome.
it is able to scan for .devhelp files generated automatically for
packages that use gtk-doc-tools to generate documentation for libraries
and programs.

devhelp provides bonobo functionality, which is used to allow command-line
searches, emacs integration and embedding in applications like the anjuta ide.
