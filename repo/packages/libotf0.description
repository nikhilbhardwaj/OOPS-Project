A library for handling opentype font - runtime
	
the libotf library provides the following facilities:

 - read open type layout tables from otf file.  currently these
   tables are supported; head, name, cmap, gdef, gsub, and gpos.
 - convert a unicode character sequence to a glyph code sequence by
   using the above tables.


the combination of libotf and the freetype library (ver.2) realizes
ctl (complex text layout) by opentype fonts.

this package contains the runtime part of libotf.
