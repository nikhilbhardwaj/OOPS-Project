Ruby interface to libxslt
	
libxslt-ruby is a simple ruby interface for processing xslt.
it's based on libxml (xmlsoft.org) and libxslt (xmlsoft.org/xslt),
including exslt support and passing parameters to stylesheets.

this is a dependency package which depends on debian's default ruby version
(currently 1.8.x).
