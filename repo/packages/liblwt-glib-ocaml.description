Cooperative glib bindings for ocaml (runtime)
	
lwt is a library of cooperative threads implemented in monadic style.
with respect to preemptive threads, cooperative threads are not using
a scheduler to distribute processor time between threads. instead of
this, each thread must tell the others that he wants to let them
work.

this package contains runtime libraries for programs using lwt with
cooperative glib in your programs.
