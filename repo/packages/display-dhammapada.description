Fortune-like collection of buddhist sayings
	
this program displays a random verse from the english or polish translations of
the dhammapada, a "versified buddhist scripture traditionally ascribed to the
buddha himself" (from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dhammapada).

as this program works similarly to fortune, one may use it in shell profiles
or .sig generators, among others.
