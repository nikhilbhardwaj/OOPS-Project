Image generator based on context-free grammars
	
context free is a program that produces images based on context-free grammars.
these grammars are sets of non-deterministic rules that determine what an
image should look like.  the resulting images often resemble a mix of
spirograph drawings, fractals and abstract art.

context free can generate images with millions of shapes, in png (up to 100
megapixels) or svg format.  it can also produce animations.  many example
images are included.
