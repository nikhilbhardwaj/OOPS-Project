Automatic theorem prover dedicated to program verification
	
alt-ergo is an automatic theorem prover dedicated to program verification.
alt-ergo is based on cc(x) a congruence closure algorithm parameterized by an
equational theory x. currently, cc(x) can be instantiated by the empty
equational theory and by the linear arithmetics. alt-ergo contains also a home
made sat-solver and an instantiation mechanism.

alt-ergo is both safe and modular: each box is described by a small set of
inference rules and is implemented as an ocaml functor.
