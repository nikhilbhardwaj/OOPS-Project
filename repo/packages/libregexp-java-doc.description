Documentation for the regular expression library
	
regexp is a 100% pure java regular expression package. regular expressions
are pattern descriptions which enable sophisticated matching of strings.
in addition to being able to match a string against a pattern, you can also
extract parts of the match. this is especially useful in text parsing!

this package provides the javadoc for the regexp api.
