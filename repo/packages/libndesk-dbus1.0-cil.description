Cli implementation of d-bus
	
ndesk-dbus is a c# implementation of d-bus. it's often referred to as
"managed d-bus" to avoid confusion with existing bindings (which wrap
libdbus).

d-bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between
applications.  conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets
and corba in terms of complexity.

this package contains the ndesk-dbus library itself.
