Java api to biological data and applications
	
this package presents the open source java api to biological databases
and a series of mostly sequence-based algorithms. the apis are not
compatible between versions. in analogy to the dealing with shared
libraries of the c language, the jar file of this package has the
api version in its name. it is symbolically linked to the expected
biojava.jar filename in the package libbiojava-java. this will help
keeping multiple versions of the biojava api in parallel.
