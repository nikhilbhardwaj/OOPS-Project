Perl interface to wordnet database
	
wordnet::querydata provides a direct interface to the wordnet database files.
it allows the user direct access to the full wordnet semantic lexicon. all
parts of speech are supported and access is generally very efficient because
the index and morphical exclusion tables are loaded at initialization. this
initialization step is slow (appx. 10-15 seconds), but queries are very fast
thereafter -- thousands of queries can be completed every second.
