Socks library for internal use by the dante client
	
dante is a circuit-level firewall/proxy that can be used to provide
convenient and secure network connectivity to a wide range of hosts
while requiring only the server dante runs on to have external network
connectivity.

this package provides the actual socks wrapper library, which should only
be used via the dante-client package's socksify(1) executable.
