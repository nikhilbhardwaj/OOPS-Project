Hp multi-point transport driver (hpmud) development libraries
	
shared library that provides direct i/o for each process. prior to
hpmud, all i/o was serialized through hpiod, a monolithic i/o processor.
the new hpmud direct i/o is faster. hpmud supports parallel, usb and
jetdirect connectivity.

with hpmud, hplip no longer has linux specific libusb extensions. this
means any unix/linux derivative that supports libusb may work with
hplip. a public hplip "c" api is exposed through hpmud. see hpmud.h
for documentation. a python wrapper for hpmud, called hpmudext, is also
available.
