X font server for truetype fonts
	
truetype fonts are generally regarded to be the best scalable fonts
for displays. applications needing scalable fonts that are to be
displayed on a screen benefit most.
this server will allow x11 applications to use the exact same fonts
as the truetype fonts used on windows operating systems.

note: this package does not contain fonts. they must be obtained separately.
