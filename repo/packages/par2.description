Parity archive volume set, for checking and repair of files
	
a command line implementation of the par v2.0 specification.  this
specification is used for parity checking and repair of a file set.
if the files in the recovery set ever get damaged (e.g. when they are
transmitted or stored on a faulty disk) the client can read the damaged
input files, read the (possibly damaged) par files, and regenerate the
original input files. of course, not all damages can be repaired, but
many can.
