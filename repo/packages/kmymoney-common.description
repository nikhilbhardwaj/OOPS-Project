Kmymoney architecture independent files
	
kmymoney is the personal finance manager for kde. it operates similar to
ms-money and quicken, supports different account types, categorisation of
expenses, qif import/export, multiple currencies and initial online banking
support.

this package contains architecture independent files needed for kmymoney to
run properly. it also provides kmymoney documentation. therefore, unless you
have 'kmymoney' package installed, you will hardly find this package useful.
