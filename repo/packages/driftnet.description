Picks out and displays images from network traffic
	
inspired by etherpeg, driftnet is a program which listens to network
traffic and picks out images from tcp streams it observes. it is
interesting to run it on a host which sees a lot of web traffic.

(obviously, this is an invasion of privacy of a fairly blatant sort.
also, if you are possessed of victorian sensibilities, and share an
unswitched network with others who are not, you should probably not
use it.)
