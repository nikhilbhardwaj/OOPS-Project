Network block device protocol - client for debian installer
	
network block device (nbd) is a client/server protocol that
emulates a block device (such as a hard disk, a floppy, or a cd-rom)
over the network, thus giving the system the ability to swap over the
network, or to use raw network disks pace for other purposes.

this package provides the client binary for nbd.

it is a minimal version meant for use in the installer only.
