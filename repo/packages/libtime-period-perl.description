Perl library for testing if a time() is in a specific period
	
this perl library provides a function which tells whether a specific
time falls within a specified time period.  its syntax for specifying
time periods allows you to test for conditions like "monday to friday,
9am till 5pm" and "on the second tuesday of the month" and "between 4pm
and 4:15pm" and "in the first half of each minute" and "in january of
1998".
