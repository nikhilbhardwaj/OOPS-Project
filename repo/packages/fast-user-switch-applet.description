Applet for the gnome panel providing a menu to switch between users
	
the fast user-switching applet is an applet for the gnome panel that
provides a menu to switch between users without logging out. it
integrates with gdm to switch between existing x11 sessions or create
new ones as needed, and shows the same users as the gdm face browser.
