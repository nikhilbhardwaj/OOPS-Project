Object-oriented php interface for the jabber/xmpp protocol
	
class.jabber.php is an object oriented solution to make jabber connectivity
for your website, bot, or even im client as simple as possible when using php.
cjp gives you complete abstraction from jabber/xmpp so that you don't have
to worry about api to the server, and instead focus on the quality of the
jabber features that you are implementing.
