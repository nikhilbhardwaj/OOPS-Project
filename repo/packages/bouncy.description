Eat the yummy veggies in the garden - game for small kids
	
you play bouncy the hungry rabbit. you're in a garden with yummy veggies and
a farmer who's not keen on you eating them. you can hide (and move around)
under the ground.

bouncy was written so it could be enjoyed by the author's daughter, who was
about to turn 3, and by older gamers. hence it's not a violent game and "easy"
is really, really easy, and "hard" is challenging.
