The gnu plotutils libraries (development files)
	
the gnu plotting utilities include programs for plotting
two-dimensional scientific data.  they are built on top of gnu
`libplot', a library for device-independent two-dimensional vector
graphics.

this package contains the header files and static libraries necessary
for building programs which use libplot.
