Tool for generating fast c-based recognizers
	
re2c is a great tool for writing fast and flexible lexers. unlike
other such tools, re2c concentrates solely on generating efficient
code for matching regular expressions. not only does this singleness
make re2c more suitable for a wider variety of applications, it
allows us to generate scanners which approach hand-crafted ones in
terms of size and speed.
