Perl module to print arrays of data in a formatted listing
	
date::showtable is a perl module which defines subroutines
to print arrays of data in a nicely formatted listing, using one of
four possible formats: simple table, boxed table, list style, and
html-formatting (for world-wide-web output).
in other words, showtable is a data formatting program.  using the
'-html' option, showtable can accept ascii tabular data and format it
appropriately for display through a web-browser.
