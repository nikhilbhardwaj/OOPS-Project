Create and manage meshes for fe or fv solvers in octave
	
this package creates and manages triangular and tetrahedral meshes
for finite element or finite volume pde solvers in octave, a
scientific computation software. it uses a mesh data structure
compatible with pdetool.  it relies on gmsh for unstructured mesh
generation.

this octave add-on package is part of the octave-forge project.
