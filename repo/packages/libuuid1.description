Universally unique id library
	
the libuuid library generates and parses 128-bit universally unique
ids (uuids).  a uuid is an identifier that is unique across both
space and time, with respect to the space of all uuids.  a uuid can
be used for multiple purposes, from tagging objects with an extremely
short lifetime, to reliably identifying very persistent objects
across a network.
