Development package for libgiigic
	
the goal of libgiigic is to provide a single easy to use, but yet powerful
api for (re)binding any kind of action to all possible input devices
through libgii at runtime.

you likely know this feature from modern computer games, where you can say
which key (= input source) is used to shoot (= action) with your shotgun.
