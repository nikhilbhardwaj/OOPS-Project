Combined parser/scanner generator for c/c++
	
the package facilitates application development including
user-defined context free languages.

its development model deviates from the traditional lex/yacc pair
(flex/bison in debian) by automating tedious tasks which are
commonly implemented in yacc's actions.

styx automatically derives a depth grammar, generates reentrant
parsers that support persistent derivation trees, preserve full
source information, support unicode and are thread safe.
