Dump arbitrary perl data structures as xml and restore them
	
this module provides a single function called dump_xml() that takes a
list of perl values as its argument and produces a string as its result.

the string returned is an xml document that represents any perl data
structures passed to the function.  reference loops are handled
correctly.
