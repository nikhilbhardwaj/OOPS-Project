Powerful webcomic downloader / archiver
	
dosage has a modular comic module infrastructure that allows new
webcomics to be easily supported, but does not limit it to supporting
webcomics with simple site layouts. dosage can retrieve just the latest
strip in a comic, catch-up to the last strip downloaded, or download a
strip for a particular date/index (except if the webcomic's site layout
makes this impossible).
