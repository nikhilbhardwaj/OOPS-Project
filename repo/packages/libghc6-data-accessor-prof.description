Utilities for accessing and manipulating fields of records; profiling libraries
	
this package provides a library for the haskell programming language
compiled for profiling.
see http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on haskell.

with this library you can define record field accessors which allow
setting, getting and modifying values easily. you can combine accessors
of a record and sub-records to make the access look like the fields
of the sub-record belong to the main record.
