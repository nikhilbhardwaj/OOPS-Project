A daemon that displays passive pop-up notifications
	
this package is a clone of notification-daemon but without gnome dependencies.
it permits doing passive popups notification on the an user desktop to notify
him about events.

as a notification daemon registers itself to d-bus, you can have only one
installed at the moment, meaning notification-daemon _or_
notification-daemon-xfce, but not both.
