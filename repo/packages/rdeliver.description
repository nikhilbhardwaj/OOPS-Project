A fully functioning mail filter with rubyfilter
	
rdeliver is a basic mail local delivery agent (deliveryagent of
rubyfilter) that can be used in place of procmail, maildrop, etc. in a
user's .forward or .qmail file.

the user supplies a delivery script that is written in ruby, which
avoids the limitations of the crippled mini-languages so often used in
other deliveryagent programs.
