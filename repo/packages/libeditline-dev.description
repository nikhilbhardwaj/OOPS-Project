Development files for libeditline
	
this is a line-editing library. it can be linked into almost any program
to provide command-line editing and recall. it is call-compatible with a
subset of the fsf readline library, but it is a fraction of the size (and
offers fewer features).

this package contains the developer files: static libraries, headers,
manpages.
