Extensible application framework
	
envisage is a python-based framework for building extensible
applications, that is, applications whose functionality can be
extended by adding "plug-ins". envisage provides a standard mechanism
for features to be added to an application, whether by the original
developer or by someone else. in fact, when you build an application
using envisage, the entire application consists primarily of
plug-ins. in this respect, it is similar to the eclipse and netbeans
frameworks for java applications.
