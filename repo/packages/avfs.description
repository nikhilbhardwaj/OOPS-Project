Virtual filesystem to access archives, disk images, remote locations
	
this fuse-base vfs (virtual filesystem) enables all programs to look inside
archived or compressed files, or access remote files without recompiling the
programs or changing the kernel.

at the moment it supports floppies, tar and gzip files, zip, bzip2, ar and rar
files, ftp sessions, http, webdav, rsh/rcp, ssh/scp. quite a few other
handlers are implemented with the midnight commander's external fs.
