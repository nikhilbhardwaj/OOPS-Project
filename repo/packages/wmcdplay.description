A cd player based on ascd designed for windowmaker
	
there's nothing in the program that makes it *require* windowmaker,
except maybe the look. it's extremely customizable, provides great
control, and runs on a 64x64 window. you can get it too look almost
like anything, provided of course you read the documentation.
