Pretty printing of mails
	
muttprint formats the printing of mutt and other mail clients to be as
pretty as the printing of mozilla or kmail.

it can print a little penguin -- or the debian logo -- on the first
page (suitable pictures can be found in the ospics package) and a headline
on every page. furthermore, it only prints the most important headers, but
not the whole plethora of them. finally, it can even print two pages on one
page in landscape format.
