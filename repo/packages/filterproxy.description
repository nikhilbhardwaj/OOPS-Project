A filtering proxy, which can among other things remove ads
	
filterproxy is a perl script that acts as a generic web proxy. it is
unique in that it allows "modules" to be installed that can perform
arbitrary transformations on html(or any other mime-type). currently
it filters ads, and compresses html content (for a 5-1 speedup on
modems!) configuration is done with web forms.
