German male voice for mbrola
	
this package contains a german diphone database provided in the context
of the mbrola project see: http://tcts.fpms.ac.be/synthesis/

de6 is a male german diphone voice created in the context of the eu project
neca (ist-2000-28580), with the aim of being particularly suitable for the
flexible synthesis of expressive speech.

the main feature of de6 is therefore that it contains a complete diphone
set for three different voice qualities defined by their vocal effort, low
effort ("soft voice"), medium effort ("normal or modal voice"), and high
effort ("loud voice").

this diphone database was recorded jointly by the institute of phonetics at
saarland university and by the language technology department at dfki,
saarbr√ºcken.
