Old style roman font
	
based on the roman of frederic goudy's kennerley old style (designed and cut
in 1911 for a limited edition of "the door in the wall and other stories" by
h g wells, published by mitchell kennerley). the companion italic is a
future project.

the letters, though not condensed, may seem to fit together like pieces of a
jigsaw puzzle, giving text an unusually solid appearance.
