Development files for parsing and querying a genders database
	
genders is a static cluster configuration database used for cluster
configuration management.  it is used by a variety of tools and
scripts for management of large clusters.  the genders database is
typically replicated on every node of the cluster. it describes the
layout and configuration of the cluster so that tools and scripts can
sense the variations of cluster nodes. by abstracting this information
into a plain text file, it becomes possible to change the
configuration of a cluster by modifying only one file.
