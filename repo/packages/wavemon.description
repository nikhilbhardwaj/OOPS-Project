Wireless device monitoring application
	
wavemon allows you to watch signal and noise levels, packet
statistics, device configuration and network parameters of your
wireless network hardware.  it has currently only been tested with
the lucent orinoco series of cards, although it *should* work (though
with varying features) with all devices supported by the wireless
kernel extensions by jean tourrilhes.
