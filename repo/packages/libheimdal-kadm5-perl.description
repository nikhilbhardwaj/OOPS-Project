Perl module to administer a heimdal kerberos kdc
	
heimdal::kadm5 is a perl module that wraps the heimdal libkadm5clnt
library and allows administration of a heimdal kdc inside perl programs.
it mimics the commands that would normally be sent to the server with the
kadmin command.  principal creation, deletion, modification, and
searching and extraction of keytabs are supported.

this module is equivalent to authen::krb5::admin except for a heimdal kdc
instead of an mit kerberos kdc.
