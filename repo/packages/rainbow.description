A bitfrost isolation shell
	
rainbow is a isolation shell which implements portions of the bitfrost
security architecture, as used on the olpc xo-1 and elsewhere.

at the moment, rainbow only knows how to provide the same primitive form
of filesystem and signal isolation that competent sysadmins provide to
users of multi-user unix shell servers.
