Development files for avahi's embeddable mdns/dns-sd library
	
avahi is a fully lgpl framework for multicast dns service discovery.
it allows programs to publish and discover services and hosts
running on a local network with no specific configuration. for
example you can plug into a network and instantly find printers to
print to, files to look at and people to talk to.

this package contains the development files for avahi's embeddable
mdns/dns-sd stack. this can be used by embedded application developers
to integrate mdns/dns-sd functionality into their applications.

you should not however use this library for non-embedded applications, you
shoudl use libavahi-client-dev which interacts with the avahi daemon.
