Cannonsmash, a table tennis simulation game
	
cannonsmash is a funny 3d table tennis game. it takes a while to get
your hand at ease with the mouse+keyboard manipulations. but once
you're used to the technique, you can feel like playing a real game.
it is playable against the computer or through a network.

since csmash relies on opengl-compatible rendering, it is best
experienced with a 3d accelerator card, although software rendering
in wireframe mode should be sustainable.
