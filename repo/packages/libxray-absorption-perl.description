X-ray absorption data for the elements
	
this module supports access to x-ray absorption data.  it is designed
to be a transparent interface to absorption data from a variety of
sources.  currently, the only sources of data are the 1969 mcmaster
tables, the 1999 elam tables, the 1993 henke tables, and the 1995
chantler tables.  the brennan-cowen implementation of the
cromer-liberman tables is available as a drop-on-top addition to this
package.  more resources can be added easily.
