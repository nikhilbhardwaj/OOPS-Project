ggz core clients enable players to access the ggz server to chat, meet
other people in the game lobbies, play with them, watch their scores,
and be spectator other people's games.

this package provides an embeddable core client as a run-time library
that can be used by gtk+ games to integrate extended ggz functionality.

this package is part of the ggz gaming zone, a multiuser networked
gaming environment.
