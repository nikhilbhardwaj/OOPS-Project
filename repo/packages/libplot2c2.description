The gnu plotutils libraries
	
the gnu plotting utilities include programs for plotting
two-dimensional scientific data.  they are built on top of gnu
`libplot', a library for device-independent two-dimensional vector
graphics.

this package contains the shared libraries used by the programmes in
plotutils to alleviate the need for packages to depend on the entire
plotutils package.
