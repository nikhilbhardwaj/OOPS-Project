Icons for creative commons and other licenses
	
liblicense implements the creative commons metadata standards for saving
and retrieving information about media files, including the license they
are under, where to get more information, and how to obtain further
permissions.  this is the package of icons used by liblicense and
perhaps useful to other programs displaying license information.
