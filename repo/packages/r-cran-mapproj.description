Gnu r support for cartographic projections of map data
	
this package provides facilities for easily producing cartographic
projections of maps based on data sets in the gnu r statistical
computing environment.  projections are used by mapmakers to
compensate for the inaccuracies inherent in projecting a spheroid's
surface onto a two-dimensional plane.
