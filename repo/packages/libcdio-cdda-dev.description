Library to read and control digital audio cds (development files)
	
this package contains development files (headers and static library)
for the libcdio-cdda library.

this library is made to read and control digital audio cds. it does
not play such cds, it only reads them digitally. as it uses libcdio as
a backend, it supports the same kind of cdrom drives (and images) as
libcdio.
