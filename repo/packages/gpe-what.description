Context-sensitive help for gpe
	
gpe-what is a notification tray applet to control
context sensitive help in the gpe palmtop environment
that replaces the mouse-over tooltips that are not usable
with the stylus commonly used with embedded devices.

when the tray icon is clicked, the system enters "help mode"; normal ui
is suspended, and the next stylus tap selects the widget for which
help is wanted. the help text, if available, is displayed in a small
pop-up bubble.
