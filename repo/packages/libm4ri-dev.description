Method of the four russians inversion library, development files
	
m4ri is a library for fast arithmetic with dense matrices over f2.
the name m4ri comes from the first implemented algorithm: the "method
of the four russians" inversion algorithm.  this algorithm in turn is
named after the "method of the four russians" multiplication
algorithm which is probably better referred to as kronrod's method.

this package contains development files for libm4ri.
