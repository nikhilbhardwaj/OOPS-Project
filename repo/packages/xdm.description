X display manager
	
xdm manages a collection of x servers, which may be on the local host or
remote machines.  it provides services similar to those provided by init,
getty, and login on character-based terminals: prompting for login name and
password, authenticating the user, and running a session.  xdm supports xdmcp
(x display manager control protocol) and can also be used to run a chooser
process which presents the user with a menu of possible hosts that offer
xdmcp display management.
