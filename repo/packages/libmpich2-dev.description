Development files for mpich2
	
mpich2 is a high-performance and widely portable implementation of the
message passing interface (mpi) standard (both mpi-1 and mpi-2). it
efficiently supports different computation and communication platforms
including commodity clusters, smps, massively parallel systems, and
high-speed networks.

this package includes the mpich2 headers and static libraries, as well
as the compiler wrappers needed to build mpich2 programs.
