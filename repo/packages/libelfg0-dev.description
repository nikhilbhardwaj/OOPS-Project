An elf object file access library: development files
	
the elf library provides routines to access, and manipulate, elf object
files. it is still not complete, but is required for a number of programs,
such as eli (a state of the art compiler generation system), and elk (the
extension language kit - an implementation of the scheme programming
language.)

this development library is only needed if you intend to compile, or
write, your own programs with this library. it holds the static linking
library (.a), and the required .so link to libelf0.so.0. to run programs
linked with this library, install the libelfg0 package.
