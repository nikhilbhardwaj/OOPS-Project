Java dtd parser library
	
dtd parsers for java seem to be pretty scarce. that's probably because dtd
isn't valid xml. at some point, if/when xml schema becomes widely accepted,
no one will need dtd parsers anymore. until then, you can use this library
to parse a dtd.

this library was packaged with argouml in mind.
