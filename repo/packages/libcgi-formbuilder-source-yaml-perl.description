Initialize formbuilder application from yaml file
	
this perl module reads a yaml file containing cgi::formbuilder configuration
options and returns a hash that can be directly fed into the application
initialization method cgi::formbuilder->new().

it uses yaml::syck as yaml backend, allowing full data structure
specification as well as code fragment specification. this is particularly
useful if you need to define validation callbacks, as if often desired
in cgi::formbuilder applications.
