Ocaml xml manipulation module
	
xmlm allows the ocaml programmer to manipulate xml data.
its complexity is half-way between the easy xml-light module and
a full parsing of xml data.

it is also very simple to updgrade existing code using xml-light
in order to use xmlm.

this package contains all the development stuff you need to develop
ocaml programs which use xmlm.
