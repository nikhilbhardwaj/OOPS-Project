Configurable suexec program for apache 2 mod_suexec
	
provides a customizable version of the suexec helper program for mod_suexec.
this is not the version from upstream, but can be configured with a
configuration file.

if you do not need non-standard document root or userdir settings, it is
recommended that you use the standard suexec helper program from the
apache2-suexec package instead.
