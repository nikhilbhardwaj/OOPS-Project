Configuration file parser library - development files
	
dot.conf is a simple-to-use and powerful configuration-file parser
library written in c. the configuration files created for dot.conf
look very similar to those used by the apache webserver. even
container-directives known from httpd.conf can easily be used in the
exact same manner as for apache-modules. it supports various types of
arguments, dynamically loadable modules that create their own
configuration options on-the-fly, a here-documents feature to pass
very long arg_str data to your app, and on-the-fly inclusion of
additional config files.

this package contains the development files necessary to build
programs using the dotconf library.
