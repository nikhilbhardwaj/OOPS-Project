Opengl tubing and extrusion library development files
	
the gle tubing and extrusion library is an extension to opengl for drawing
tubing and extrusions, including surfaces of revolution, sweeps, tubes,
polycones, polycylinders, and helicoids.  generally the extruded surface
is specified with a 2d polyline that is extruded along a 3d path.  a local
coordinate system allows for additional flexibility in the primitives
drawn.  extrusions may be texture mapped in a variety of ways.

this package contains header files and static libraries.
