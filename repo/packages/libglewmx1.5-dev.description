The opengl extension wrangler - development environment
	
the opengl extension wrangler, glew for short, is a library that
handles initiliazation of opengl extensions in a portable and simple
way.  once the program initializes the library and checks the
availability of extensions, it can safely call the entry points defined
by the extension.  currently glew supports almost all the extensions
found in the opengl extension registry[1].

this package contains the development libraries compiled with glew_mx
