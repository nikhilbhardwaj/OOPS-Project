Nec structure and gain pattern viewer
	
xnecview allows a representation of a nec (numerical electromagnetics
code) structure, such as an antenna which is to be modelled to be
displayed on the screen.  after an nec run the gain pattern in various
formats can also be superimposed.  this can be rotated and translated for
viewing from different angles.  plots of swr and gain as a function of
frequency can also be produced.  in addition to on screen display,
postscript or png output can also be produced.
