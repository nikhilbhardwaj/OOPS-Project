Computer algebra system
	
yacas is a small and highly flexible computer algebra language.

the syntax is very close to mathematica. the distribution contains
a small library of mathematical functions, but its real strength
is in the language in which you can easily write your own symbolic
manipulation algorithms. it supports arbitrary precision arithmetic.
