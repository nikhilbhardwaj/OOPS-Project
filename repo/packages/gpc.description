The gnu pascal compiler
	
this is the gnu pascal compiler, which compiles pascal on platforms supported
by the gcc compiler. it uses the gcc backend to generate optimized code.

the current version 2.2 (release candidate 2) implements standard pascal
(iso 7185, level 1), a large subset of extended pascal (iso 10206), and
borland pascal. many borland pascal units supported.

this is a dependency package providing the default gnu pascal compiler.
