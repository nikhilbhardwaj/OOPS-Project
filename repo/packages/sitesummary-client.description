Generate site summary of submitting hosts (client part)
	
the sitesummary system makes it easier to keep track of a lot of
machines, by allowing each machine to report their existence once a
day to a central collector, and using this collector to make summary
reports about the hosts.

this package is the client part, reporting in to the server after
boot and once a day.
