Stateful programmatic web browsing
	
a library for browsing the web in python. mechanize acts like a browser
allowing you to do web scraping, functional testing of web sites and
things no one has thought of yet.

among other things, mechanize:

 * follows links
 * fills in html forms
 * automatically observes robots.txt
 * has a browser history


it was modelled after the perl module www::mechanize.
