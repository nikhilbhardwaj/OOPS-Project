Extremely simple mta to get mail off the system to a mail hub
	
a secure, effective and simple way of getting mail off a system to your
mail hub. it contains no suid-binaries or other dangerous things - no mail
spool to poke around in, and no daemons running in the background. mail is
simply forwarded to the configured mailhost. extremely easy configuration.

warning: the above is all it does; it does not receive mail, expand aliases
or manage a queue. that belongs on a mail hub with a system administrator.
