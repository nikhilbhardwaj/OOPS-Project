Bickley daemons for meta data management api and framework
	
bickley metadata system are made by two daemons: bkl-orbiter and
bkl-investigator. bkl-orbiter is always running and keeps track of various
sources, watching for files on the sources that need to be indexed.
when it has found something that needs extracting, the bkl-investigator is
started and scans the file for metadata which it then sends to the orbiter.
the orbiter puts this metadata into the database.
