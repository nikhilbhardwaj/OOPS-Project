Displays a graph detailing memory usage of each process
	
gmemusage is a graphical program modelled after the silicon graphics inc.
program of the same name. gmemusage displays a window with a stacked bar.
areas on the bar correspond to individual processes running on the system
and are updated periodically. multiple copies of the same program
(actually, programs with the same name) are merged into one area on the
stack. sizes of areas in the stack correspond to resident sizes of the
processes.
