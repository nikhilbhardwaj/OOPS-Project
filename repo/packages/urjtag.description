Jtag programmer for various flash parts and boards
	
a command line tool for communicating over jtag (ieee 1149.1) with various
flash chips, cpus, boards and jtag adapters.

it has an open and modular architecture with the ability to write
miscellaneous extensions (like board testers, or flash memory programmers).

this is a (more actively maintained) fork of the 'openwince-jtag' software.
