Text-based minesweeper
	
freesweep is an implementation of the popular minesweeper game, where
one tries to find all the mines without igniting any, based on hints given
by the computer.  unlike most implementations of this game, freesweep
works in any visual text display - in linux console, in an xterm, and in
most text-based terminals currently in use.
