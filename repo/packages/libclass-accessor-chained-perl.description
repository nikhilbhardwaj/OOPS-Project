Make chained accessors
	
a chained accessor is one that always returns the object when called
with parameters (to set), and the value of the field when called with
no arguments.

this module subclasses class::accessor in order to provide the same
mk_accessors interface.

this description was automagically extracted from the module by dh-make-perl.
