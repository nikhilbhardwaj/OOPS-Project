Sends icmp_echo requests to network hosts
	
oping uses icmp packages (better known as "ping packets") to test the
reachability of network hosts. it supports pinging multiple hosts in parallel
using ipv4 and/or ipv6 transparently.

this package contains two command line applications: "oping" is a replacement
for tools like ping(1), ping6(1) and fping(1). "noping" is an ncurses-based
tool which displays statistics while pinging and highlights aberrant
round-trip times.
