Developer files for the silc library (silc-toolkit)
	
silc (secure internet live conferencing) is a network protocol designed
to provide end-to-end security for conferencing services. silc has a
command set and a user interface similar to irc, but the network
protocol is completely different as it supports public key strong
cryptography and a different network model.

this package contains headers and documentation for both the generic silc
library (libsilc) and the client library (libsilcclient).
