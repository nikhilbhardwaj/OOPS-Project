Scalable directory/file change notification
	
this module implements an interface to the linux 2.6.13 and later inotify
file/directory change notification sytem.

it has a number of advantages over the linux::inotify module:

 - it is portable (linux::inotify only works on x86)
 - the equivalent of fullname works correctly
 - it is better documented
 - it has callback-style interface, which is better suited for

integration.
