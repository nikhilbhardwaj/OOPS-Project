View multiple logfiles windowed on console
	
multitail lets you view one or multiple files like the original tail
program.

the difference is that this program creates multiple windows on
your console (with ncurses). it can also use colors while displaying the
logfiles for faster recognizing which lines are important and which are
not.

it is optimized for terminal-sessions through slow links.
