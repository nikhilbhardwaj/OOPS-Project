Port for python of the openal library
	
this is the port for python of the openal library, a portable library for
3d spatialized audio.

openal, the open audio library, is a joint effort to create an open,
vendor-neutral, cross-platform api for interactive, primarily spatialized
audio. openal's primary audience are application developers and desktop
users that rely on portable standards like opengl, for games and other
multimedia applications.
