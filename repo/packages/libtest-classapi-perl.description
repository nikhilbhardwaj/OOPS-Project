Perl extension for basic first-pass api testing for class trees
	
for many apis with large numbers of classes, it can be very useful to be able
to do a quick once-over to make sure that classes, methods, and inheritance
is correct, before doing more comprehensive testing.
this module aims to provide such a capability.
