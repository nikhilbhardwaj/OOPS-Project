Runtime libraries for apron
	
the apron library is dedicated to the static analysis of the numerical
variables of a program by abstract interpretation. the aim of such an analysis
is to infer invariants about these variables. it is intended to be a common
interface to various underlying libraries/abstract domains and to provide
additional services that can be implemented independently from the underlying
library/abstract domain.

this package contains the shared libraries needed at runtime.
