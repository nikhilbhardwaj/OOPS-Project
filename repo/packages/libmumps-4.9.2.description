Direct linear systems solver - parallel shared libraries
	
mumps implements a direct solver for large sparse linear systems, with a
particular focus on symmetric positive definite matrices.  it can
operate on distributed matrices e.g. over a cluster.  it has fortran and
c interfaces, and can interface with ordering tools such as scotch.
