Xfs filesystem-specific static libraries and headers
	
xfslibs-dev contains the libraries and header files needed to
develop xfs filesystem-specific programs.

xfs is a high performance journaling filesystem which originated
on the sgi irix platform.  it is completely multi-threaded, can
support large files and large filesystems, extended attributes,
variable block sizes, is extent based, and makes extensive use of
btrees (directories, extents, free space) to aid both performance
and scalability.
