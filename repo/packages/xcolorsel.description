Display colors and names in x
	
xcolorsel is an x utility that displays the contents of the x color list
file (/etc/x11/rgb.txt) together with tiles showing how the color looks on
your screen.  you can cut the color names/definitions in various formats
(suitable for resource files or c source) so they can be pasted directly
into source codes or resources.
