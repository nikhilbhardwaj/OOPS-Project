A gui for verifying and repairing par and par2 recovery sets
	
a simple, easy to use graphical interface for verification and repair of
par v1.0 and par v2.0(par2) recovery sets. par1 support is currently minimal,
as it is deprecated this most likely will not change, so do not expect the
headers, progress, output, and status to update when performing actions
on these.
