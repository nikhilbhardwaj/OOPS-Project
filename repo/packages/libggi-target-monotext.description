General graphics interface plain text target
	
"general graphics interface" - a fast, portable graphics environment.

this package contains the driver for the "monotext" target, enabling
libggi (and therefore any program using libggi) to display its output
as ascii art.  this driver does not use the "aalib" ascii art library;
"monotext" is an independent implementation of the same idea.

the monotext target requires a text-capable target, such as the
"terminfo" target, to display its output.
