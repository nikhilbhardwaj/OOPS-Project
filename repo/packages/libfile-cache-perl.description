File::cache, a filesystem-based object store
	
file::cache implements an object store which shares data across process
boundaries via the filesystem. it was written to complement ipc::cache, but
is suitable for larger numbers of more complex objects than that module.

this module will eventually be superseded by the newer cache::cache.
