Advanced clone of the mastermind code-breaking game
	
colorcode is an advanced mastermind code-breaking game clone. the
program accepts setting the number of slots (from 2 to 5), the number
of colors (from 2 to 10) and setting if colors might be repeated in
the secret code (doubles allowed or not).  the game has 5 built-in
levels, from level 1 (beginner: 2 slots and 2 colors, with doubles
allowed) to level 5 (hard: 5 slots and 10 colors, with doubles
allowed). colorcode can make guesses in place of the user.
