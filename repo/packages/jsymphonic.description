File manager for sony's mp3 players
	
symphonic is a file manager for sony's flash players (such as the
nw-e00x series), where songs are stored in a proprietary format
not very unix-friendly.

this program provides functionalities similar to the proprietary
windows-only sonicstage software given by sony to interact with
the players.
