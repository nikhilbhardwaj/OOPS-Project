Java library to generate pdf on the fly
	
itext is a library that allows you to generate pdf files on the fly.
the itext classes are very useful for people who need to generate read-only,
platform independent documents containing text, lists, tables and images.
the library is especially useful in combination with java(tm)
technology-based servlets: the look and feel of html is browser dependent;
with itext and pdf you can control exactly how your servlet's output will look.
itext requires jdk 1.2. it's available for free under a multiple license:
mpl and lgpl.
