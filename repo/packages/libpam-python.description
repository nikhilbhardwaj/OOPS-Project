Enables pam modules to be written in python
	
this pam module runs the python interpreter, thus allowing pam
modules to be written in python.  as a python incurs a considerable
overhead its intended audience is sysadmins writing one off pam
modules.  if you are doing that, you should probably install
the documentation in libpam-python-doc as well.
