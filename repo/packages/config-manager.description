Manage directories with arch, bazaar, cvs, http, ftp and/or subversion
	
config-manager is designed to manage directory trees. the components of
a directory may be specified by a location from any of:


 - arch
 - bazaar (bzr)
 - cvs
 - ftp
 - http
 - subversion (svn)


these directory trees are described by recipes (also known as
configs) and are typically used to build software although nothing
within config-manager prevents their use in, for example, web sites.
