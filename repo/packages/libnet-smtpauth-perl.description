Perl module that provides smtp authentication (net::smtp_auth)
	
this module implements a client interface to the smtp and esmtp protocol
auth service extension, enabling a perl5 application to talk to and
authenticate against smtp servers.

this module supplies a more powerful environment than net::smtp (provided
by perl-modules).
