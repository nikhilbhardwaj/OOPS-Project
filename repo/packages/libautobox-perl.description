Perl pragma for method calls on native types
	
autobox is a perl pragma that enables method calls on perl's native data types
including numeric values (integers and floats), strings, arrays, hashes and
even code references in a simple and consistent way.

when a method is invoked on something which is not a blessed object reference,
autobox looks for the method in a package whose name corresponds to the ref()
type of the value. this design means extending the default functionality for
new methods on a type-by-type basis is very simple.
