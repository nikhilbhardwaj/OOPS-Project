Swiss (german) orthography wordlist
	
this is a wordlist with the new german orthography (de-ch-1996), which
is used since 1998-08-01 and which is obligatory as of 2005-08-01.

it is based on the famous hkgerman dictionary (using the old german
orthography, which is available as wogerman), with many corrections
and additions.

this particular rendering supports swiss spelling.  this includes some
swiss words, as well as ss instead of german sz ligature.
