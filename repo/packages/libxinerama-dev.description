X11 xinerama extension library (development headers)
	
libxinerama provides an x window system client interface to the xinerama
extension to the x protocol.

the xinerama (also known as panoramix) extension allows for multiple screens
attached to a single display to be treated as belonging together, and to give
desktop applications a better idea of the monitor layout.

this package contains the development headers for the library found in
libxinerama1.  non-developers likely have little use for this package.
