Stress-test programs by giving them random input
	
the fuzz generator is designed to attack certain kinds of software and
expose one particular kind of bug common in software. this is the
situation where the programmer implicitly makes some assumptions about
the data stream that the program will be parsing. if the data stream
is substantially different then the program might not be able to deal
with it.
