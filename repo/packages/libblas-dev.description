Basic linear algebra subroutines 3, static library
	
this package is a binary incompatible upgrade to the blas-dev
package. several minor changes to the c interface have been
incorporated.

blas (basic linear algebra subroutines) is a set of efficient
routines for most of the basic vector and matrix operations.
they are widely used as the basis for other high quality linear
algebra software, for example lapack and linpack.  this
implementation is the fortran 77 reference implementation found
at netlib.

this package contains a static version of the library.
