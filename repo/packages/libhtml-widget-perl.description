Html widget and validation framework
	
html::widget makes creating and maintaining html widgets easy.

everything is optional, use validation only or just generate forms, you can
embed and merge them later.

the api was designed similar to other popular modules like
data::formvalidator and formvalidator::simple, html::fillinform is also
built in (and much faster).
