Configuration tool for pointing devices (transitional package)
	
package to ease upgrading from gsynaptics to gpointing-device-settings.
reason for this is that gsynaptics is not compatible with recent xservers
and upstream now develops gpointing-device-settings instead.

this package can be purged at anytime once the gpointing-device-settings
package has been installed.
