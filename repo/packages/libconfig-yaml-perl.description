Module for manipulating yaml-based configuration files
	
config::yaml is a somewhat object-oriented wrapper around the yaml module
designed to make reading and writing configuration files simple. it handles
multiple configuration files (e.g. system and per-user configuration or a
gallery application with per-directory configuration) with ease.
