Utilities from the iksemel library
	
iksemel handles jabber connections, parses xml, and sends and
receives jabber messages. it works pretty good for parsing other
kinds of xml, too, if the need arises.

this package includes three utilitaries from the library: ikslint,
which checks xml files for well-formedness, iksperf, which tests
speed and memory usage, and, finally, iksroster, which backups your
roster.
