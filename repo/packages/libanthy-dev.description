Input method for japanese - development files
	
anthy is a japanese input method working on x11 and emacs. it converts
hiragana text to mixed kana and kanji. it is implemented as a library
and stores private information securely in ~/.anthy/.
thus, anthy is simple and secure (information is protected from
spoofing and snooping).

this package provides the files necessary for compiling programs that
depend on anthy.
