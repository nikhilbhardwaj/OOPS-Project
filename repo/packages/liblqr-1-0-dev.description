Converts plain array images into multi-size representation (developments files)
	
the liquidrescale (lqr) library provides a c/c++ api for performing
non-uniform resizing of images by the seam-carving technique.

the library takes images in plain array format as input and converts
them to a multi-size representation.

following is a list of features:


  * areas in the image can be marked for preservation or discard
  * once the image has been fully processed, the scaling can be done
    in real-time. in fact, the information can be saved and read out
    later without any further processing
  * the resizing is done with a single function which automatically
    performs all the necessary operations; it can also work in
    successive steps without wasting computational time
  * possibility to tune the carving operation by letting the seams be
    less connected, or more rigid, or both
  * can export and import the visibility map (the seams)
  * other images can be attached and undergo the same carving process
    as the parent image
  * the automatic feature detection algorithm can be tuned by
    selecting among different energy gradient functions
  * reports progress through a customizable interface
  * a signalling system permits to cleanly handle errors


the library implements the algorithm described in the paper "seam
carving for content-aware image resizing" by shai avidan and ariel
shamir, which can be found at

this package contains the development files.
