Module to find differences between files (xs accelerated)
	
algorithm::diff::xs is a perl diff utility module based on joe schaefer's
excellent but not very well-known algorithm::lcs module, with a drop-in
interface identical to algorithm::diff.

note that only the lcsidx function is optimized in xs at the moment, which
means only compact_diff will get significantly faster for large data sets,
while diff and sdiff will run in identical speed as algorithm::diff.
