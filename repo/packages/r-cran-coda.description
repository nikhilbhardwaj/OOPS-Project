Output analysis and diagnostics for mcmc simulations in r
	
this package provides output analysis and diagnostics for markov chain
monte carlo simulations and estimations within r.  it also includes some
graphical analysis routines and a facility for importing output from bugs
(bayes using gibbs sampling), a popular tool for running mcmc simulations.

the related r-cran-mcmcpack package includes mcmc estimators for some
common models in the social sciences.
