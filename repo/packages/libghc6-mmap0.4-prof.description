Memory mapped files for posix and windows; profiling libraries
	
this package provides a library for the haskell programming language,
compiled for profiling.
see http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on haskell.

this library provides a wrapper to mmap(2) or mapviewoffile, allowing files or
devices to be lazily loaded into memory as strict or lazy bytestrings,
foreignptrs or plain ptrs, using the virtual memory subsystem to do on-demand
loading. modifications are also supported.
