Automatic command-line mp3/ogg/flac file tagger and renamer
	
lltag is a command-line tool manipulating mp3 id3, ogg or flac tags.
it may be used to tag multiples files at once by comparing their filename
or pathname against a configurable list of formats, or by getting tags
from the cddb database.

lltag may also rename files according to a configurable filename format.
the interface has been designed to be as automatic, efficient and smart
as possible.
