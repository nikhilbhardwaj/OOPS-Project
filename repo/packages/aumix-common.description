Simple text-based mixer control program (common files)
	
aumix is a small, easy-to-use program to control the mixer of your sound
card. it runs in text mode using the ncurses library, or from the command
line (non-interactively). it can read default settings from a file, and it
can also automatically save and restore the mixer settings at shutdown and
boot.

this package provides files common to aumix and aumix-gtk.
