A distributed version (revision) control system - server scripts
	
monotone is a free, distributed version control system. it provides
fully disconnected operation, manages complete tree versions, keeps
its state in a local transactional database, supports overlapping
branches and extensible metadata, uses an efficient peer-to-peer
network protocol, performs history-sensitive merging, and delegates
trust functions to client-side rsa certificates.

this package contains scripts to facilitate running a monotone server.
