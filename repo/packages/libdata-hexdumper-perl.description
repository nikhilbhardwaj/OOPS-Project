Make binary data human-readable
	
data::hexdumper provides a simple way to format arbitary binary data into a
nice human-readable format, somewhat similar to the unix 'hexdump' utility.

it gives the programmer a considerable degree of flexibility in how the data
is formatted, with sensible defaults. it is envisaged that it will primarily
be of use for those wrestling alligators in the swamp of binary file formats,
which is why it was written in the first place.
