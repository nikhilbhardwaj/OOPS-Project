Package manager for rpm
	
the rpm package manager (rpm) is a command-line driven package
management system capable of installing, uninstalling, verifying,
querying, and updating computer software packages.

on debian and derived systems it is recommended to use "alien" to
convert rpm packages into .deb format instead of bypassing the debian
package management system by installing them directly with rpm.
