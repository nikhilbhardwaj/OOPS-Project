Perl module to determine the executing subroutine
	
sub::current provides a fairly magical function called routine() which returns
a code reference pointing at the currently executing subroutine. it does not
make sense to use this inside a special block (such as begin, end, unitcheck,
check or init) or at the top level of a program, so routine will return undef.
