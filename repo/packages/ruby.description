An interpreter of object-oriented scripting language ruby
	
ruby is the interpreted scripting language for quick and
easy object-oriented programming.  it has many features to
process text files and to do system management tasks (as in
perl).  it is simple, straight-forward, and extensible.

this package is a dependency package, which depends on debian's default
ruby version (currently 1.8.x).
