Font editor - python bindings
	
besides being a font editor, fontforge is also a font format
converter, and can convert among postscript (ascii & binary type 1,
some type 3s, some type 0s), truetype, and opentype (type2),
cid-keyed, svg, cff and multiple-master fonts.

this package provides the python modules (the libraries fontforge and
psmat) to access a fontforge program for font manipulations.
