Organizer for /usr/local software packages
	
gnu stow is a software installation manager for /usr/local.  using
symbolic links, gnu stow helps you keep the installations separate
(/usr/local/stow/emacs vs. /usr/local/stow/perl, for example) while
maintaining the illusion that they are all under /usr/local.
