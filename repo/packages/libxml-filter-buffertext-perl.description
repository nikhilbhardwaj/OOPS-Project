Perl module for putting all characters into a single event
	
the xml::filter::buffertext module is a very simple filter.  one common
cause of grief (and programmer error) is that xml parsers aren't required
to provide character events in one chunk.  they can, but are not forced
to, and most don't.  this filter does the trivial but oft-repeated task
of putting all characters into a single event.
