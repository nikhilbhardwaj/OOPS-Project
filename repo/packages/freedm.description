Multiplayer-oriented maps for doom
	
freedoom is a project to create a complete doom ii-compatible iwad file
which is free software.

freedm is a sub-project to create a set of levels designed for deathmatch
play.

freedm does not require freedoom to play and can be used in conjunction
with a boom-engine. please note that this is designed for multiplayer and
will not be of much use for single player.
