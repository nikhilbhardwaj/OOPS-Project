Module implementing getaddrinfo and getnameinfo
	
socket::getaddrinfo provides a perl implementation of the getaddrinfo and
getnameinfo functions as described in rfc 2553. these functions are useful for
converting between a pair of host name/service name and socket addresses, or
vice versa.

this module uses underlying c code to do most of the work if possible, but can
also fall back on some mostly-compatible emulation code written in perl. this
means that this module is a fairly portable implementation of these functions.
