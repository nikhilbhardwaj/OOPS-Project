Gnu r scripting and command-line front-end
	
the 'r' (aka 'littler') program provides a leightweight binary wrapper around
the gnu r language and environment for statistical computing and graphics.

while r can be used in batch mode, the r binary adds full support for
both 'shebang'-style scripting (i.e. using a  hashmark-exclamation-path
expression as the first line in scripts) as well as command-line use in
standard unix pipelines. in other words, r provides the r language without
the environment.
