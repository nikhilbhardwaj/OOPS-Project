Dancer documentation
	
dancer-ircd is the former freenode ircd, loosely derived from the
hybrid ircd used on efnet.

it endeavours to handle the network transparently as a unit, and to
provide features to support the freenode philosophy.

this package contains all the documentation that comes in the original
tarball.
