Simple linux kernel inotify wrapper for monitoring file and directory changes
	
this is a simple ruby wrapper over the inotify linux kernel subsystem
for monitoring changes to files and directories. it uses the ffi ruby
library to avoid having to compile a c extension

this is a dependency package which depends on debian's default ruby version
(currently 1.8).
