Poe event loop implementation using tk
	
poe::loop::tk implements the standard poe::loop event loop interface for the
tk toolkit. it provides features needed to manage a tk-based event loop in
perl in a consistent fashion and does not differ from the standard interface.
please see poe::loop from libpoe-perl for details on how this works.
