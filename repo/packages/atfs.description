The attributed file system (atfs)
	
atfs is a storage system supporting multiple versions of files and
associating an arbitrary number of application defined attributes
of the form "name=value" with each version. atfs comes as a function
library that is meant as an extension to the unix file system. it does
this without the need for kernel modifications and without imposing any
restrictions to existing file system applications. it is part of shapetools,
a software configuration management system.
