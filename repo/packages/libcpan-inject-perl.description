Class for injecting distributions into cpan sources
	
cpan::inject provides a simple and reusable interface for injecting arbitrary
packages to a cpan mirror. specifically, it takes an arbitrary tarball and
adds it to the cpan sources directory for a particular author, then updating
the checksums file accordingly. it replicates the functionality provided to
mini cpan installations via cpan::mini::inject, but in a generalized manner.
