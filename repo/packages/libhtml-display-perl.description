Module for displaying html locally in a browser
	
html::display abstracts the task of displaying html to the user. the
displaying is done by launching a browser and navigating it to either a
temporary file with the html stored in it, or, if possible, by pushing the
html directly into the browser window.

the module tries to automagically select the "correct" browser, but if it
doesn't find a good browser, you can modify the behaviour by setting some
environment variables.
