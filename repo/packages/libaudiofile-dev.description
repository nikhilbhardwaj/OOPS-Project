Open-source version of sgi's audiofile library (header files)
	
the audiofile library allows the processing of audio data to and from audio
files of many common formats (currently aiff, aiff-c, wave, next/sun, bics,
and raw data).

this package contains the development headers and library files needed to
compile programs using libaudiofile, as well as example programs for
identifying and converting audio files.
