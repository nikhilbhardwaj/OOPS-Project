Poe component for communicating over jabber
	
poe::component::jabber is a module that simplies for the poe developer, access
to the jabber protocol through the use of one of the four client classes. with
built in events for common jabber packets, all a poe developer need do is
provide an event and arguments for most events so the responses to the
requests can be properly handled by the coder.

please see the client classes for more detailed descriptions of the events
provided.
