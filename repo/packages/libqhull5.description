Calculate convex hulls and related structures (shared library)
	
qhull computes convex hulls, delaunay triangulations, halfspace
intersections about a point, voronoi diagrams, furthest-site
delaunay triangulations, and furthest-site voronoi diagrams. it
runs in 2-d, 3-d, 4-d, and higher dimensions.

this package contains the shared c library.
