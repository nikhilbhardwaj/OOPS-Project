Server daemon and test client for stun
	
the stun protocol (simple traversal of udp through nats) is described in the
ietf rfc 3489, available at http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3489.txt.  it's used to
help clients behind nat to tunnel incoming calls through. this server is the
counterpart to help the client identify the nat and have it open the proper
ports for it.
