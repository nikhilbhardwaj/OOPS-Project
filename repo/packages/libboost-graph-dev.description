Generic graph components and algorithms in c++ (default version)
	
this package forms part of the boost c++ libraries collection.

graphs are mathematical abstractions that are useful for solving
many types of problems in computer science. consequently, these
abstractions must also be represented in computer programs. a
standardized generic interface for traversing graphs is of utmost
importance to encourage reuse of graph algorithms and data structures.

this package is a dependency package, which depends on debian's default
boost version (currently 1.42).
