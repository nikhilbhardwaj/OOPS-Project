Perl extension for an event loop using epoll
	
io::async::loop::epoll is a perl module that provides an implementation of
an event loop that uses the epoll() system call. the epoll system call, which
is currently only available on linux, scales in constant o(1) time. for many
open filehandles, you will get significantly better performance using this
algorithm.

it uses the io::epoll (libio-epoll-perl) module for this functionality.
