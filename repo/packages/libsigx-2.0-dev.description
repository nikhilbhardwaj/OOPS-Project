Interthread communication for c++ - development files
	
this library is an interthread communication library for c++ on top of
libsigc++ and glibmm. it provides dispatcher based interthread communication,
typesafe functor adaptors to execute functions in the context of another
thread, threadsafe wrappers for signals and connections, and deadlock detection
for synchronous messages.

this package contains the development files for libsigx, needed only if you
wish to write or compile software which uses it.
