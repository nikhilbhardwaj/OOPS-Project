Nss module for using berkeley databases as a naming service
	
nss_db is a set of c library extensions which allow berkeley databases
to be used as a primary source of aliases, ethers, groups, hosts,
networks, protocol, users, rpcs, services, and shadow passwords (instead
of or in addition to using flat files or nis). install nss_db if your
flat name service files are too large and lookups are slow.
