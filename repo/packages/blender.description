Very fast and versatile 3d modeller/renderer
	
blender is an integrated 3d suite for modelling, animation, rendering,
post-production, interactive creation and playback (games). blender has its
own particular user interface, which is implemented entirely in opengl and
designed with speed in mind. python bindings are available for scripting;
import/export features for popular file formats like 3d studio and wavefront
obj are implemented as scripts by the community. stills, animations, models
for games or other third party engines and interactive content in the form of
a standalone binary and/or a web plug-in are common products of blender use.
