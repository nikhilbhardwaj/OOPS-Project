Legacy bios implementation
	
seabios is a legacy bios implementation, aimed at supporting not only
emulated hosts such as qemu, but also real hardware.

note, however, that seabios does not handle early initialization of core
chipsets, so don't even think of flashing it to your board (look at
coreboot for that).
