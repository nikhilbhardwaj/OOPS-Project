A simple syntax checker for latex
	
lacheck is a simple syntax checker for latex that is based on a
single-pass lexical scanner. this makes clear that there are a lot of
latex problems this program cannot find, although it will find most
simple mistakes.  complex macro packages may, however, make it completely
unusable.

this program was bundled with auctex once upon a time and is best known
from there.
