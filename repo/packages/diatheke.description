Command line bible browsing and search tool
	
the sword project is an open source, cross-platform (linux, windows, solaris,
macosx etc.) api/library for bible software with a constantly growing list
of front-ends (gui, textmode, web-based, etc.) and a library of over 200
text modules.

this package contains a command line utility for sword, allowing
bible browsing and searching. this tool is used mostly only for
library testing. nicer front-ends are xiphos (gtk), bibletime (qt)
and others.
