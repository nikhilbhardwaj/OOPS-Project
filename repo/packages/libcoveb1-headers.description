Cache oblivious van emde boas tree header files (coveb library)
	
libcoveb is a library for storing a priority queue of 32-bit integers
efficiently.  it is faster than the stl, and provides o(log(log(n))) type
performance for most operations.  this means that, in practical terms, it
does not exhibit much noticeable slowdown behavior as it scales from just
a few entries all the way up to 2 or 4 billion entries in the queue.  the
data structure is a van emde boas stratified tree, and this has been
theoretically shown to work well under any size cache.
