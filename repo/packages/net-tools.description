this package includes the important tools for controlling the network
subsystem of the linux kernel.  this includes arp, ifconfig, netstat,
rarp, nameif and route.  additionally, this package contains utilities
relating to particular network hardware types (plipconfig, slattach,
mii-tool) and advanced aspects of ip configuration (iptunnel, ipmaddr).

in the upstream package 'hostname' and friends are included. those are
not installed by this package, since there is a special "hostname*.deb".
