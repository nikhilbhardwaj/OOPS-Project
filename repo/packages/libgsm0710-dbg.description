Debugging symbols for use with libgsm0710
	
this library provides a lightweight implementation of the 3gpp gsm 07.10
multiplexing protocol. in conjunction with libgsm0710mux it provides
the base for multiplexing in the freesmartphone.org software stack.

this package contains unstripped shared libraries. it is provided primarily
to provide a backtrace with names in a debugger, this makes it somewhat easier
to interpret core dumps. the libraries are installed in /usr/lib/debug and
are automatically used by gdb.
