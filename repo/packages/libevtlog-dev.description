Syslog even logger library development files
	
the eventlog library aims to be a replacement of the simple syslog() api
provided on unix systems. the major difference between eventlog and syslog
is that eventlog tries to add structure to messages.

eventlog provides an interface to build, format and output an event record.
the exact format and output method can be customized by the administrator
via a configuration file.

this package contains the development files.
