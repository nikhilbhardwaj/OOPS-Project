The telnet server with ssl encryption support
	
the in.telnetd program is a server which supports the darpa telnet interactive
communication protocol.

ssl telnetd replaces normal telnetd using ssl authentication and
encryption. it interoperates with normal telnetd in both directions.
it checks if the other side is also talking ssl, if not it falls back
to normal telnet protocol.

advantages over normal telnetd: your passwords and the data you send
will not go in cleartext over the line. nobody can get it with
tcpdump or similar tools.
