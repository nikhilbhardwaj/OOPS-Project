Tool for reporting changes in system configuration
	
this tool is run by a nightly cron job, and takes a `diff' of specified system
configuration files and emails them to a specified email address.  options
to diff can be specified.  this is useful in friendly environments where there
are multiple sysadmins working on configuration files/setups and everyone's
changes are reported.  cvs is a better answer, but most of us don't want to
have the hassle of putting system files in a repository.
