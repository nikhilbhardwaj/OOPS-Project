Behaviour driven development framework for ruby
	
rspec is a behaviour driven development framework for ruby. it
provides two frameworks for writing and executing examples of how your
ruby application should behave:

  * a story framework for describing behaviour at the application level
  * a spec framework for describing behaviour at the object level


this is a dependency package, which depends on a librspec package
built for the default ruby version.
