Small, but very powerful and efficient web server and mail proxy
	
nginx (engine x) is a web server created by igor sysoev and kindly provided to
the open-source community. this server can be used as standalone http server
and as a reverse proxy server before some apache or another big server to
reduce load to backend servers by many concurrent http-sessions.

it can also act as a pop3/imap mail proxy with ssl and tls sni support.
