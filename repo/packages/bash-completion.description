Programmable completion for the bash shell
	
bash completion extends bash's standard completion behavior to achieve
complex command lines with just a few keystrokes.  this project was
conceived to produce programmable completion routines for the most
common linux/unix commands, reducing the amount of typing sysadmins
and programmers need to do on a daily basis.
