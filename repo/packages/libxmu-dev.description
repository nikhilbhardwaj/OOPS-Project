X11 miscellaneous utility library (development headers)
	
libxmu provides a set of miscellaneous utility convenience functions for x
libraries to use.  libxmuu is a lighter-weight version that does not depend
on libxt or libxext; for more information, see libxmuu1.

this package contains the development headers for the library found in
libxmu6.  non-developers likely have little use for this package.
