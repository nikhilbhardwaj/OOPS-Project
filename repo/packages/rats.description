Rough auditing tool for security
	
rats is a security auditing utility for c, c++, php, perl, and python
code. rats scans source code, finding potentially dangerous function calls.
the goal of rats is not to definitively find bugs (yet), but to provide a
reasonable starting point for performing manual security audits.

the initial vulnerability database is taken directly from things that
could be easily found when starting with the book, "building secure
software" by viega and mcgraw.
