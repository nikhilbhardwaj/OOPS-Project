Simple wiki implementation with built-in webserver
	
didiwiki is aimed at those who need a quick and lightweight wiki for
personal use, such as notes, "to do" lists, etc. it is written in c,
and has very low system requirements (binary size of ~25k
stripped). this makes it particularly useful for handhelds. didiwiki
does not require installation of a separate webserver, scripting
language, or database.
