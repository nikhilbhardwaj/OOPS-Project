s-lang is a c programmer's library that includes routines for the rapid
development of sophisticated, user friendly, multi-platform applications.

the s-lang library includes the following:

 * low level tty input routines for reading single characters at a time.
 * keymap routines for defining keys and manipulating multiple keymaps.
 * a high-level key processing interface (slkp) for
   handling function and arrow keys.
 * high level screen management routines for manipulating both
   monochrome and color terminals. these routines are very
   efficient. (slsmg)
 * low level terminal-independent routines for manipulating the display
   of a terminal. (sltt)
 * routines for reading single line input with line editing and recall
   capabilities. (slrline)
 * searching functions: both ordinary searches and regular expression
