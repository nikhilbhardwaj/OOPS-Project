Screensaver showing collective dream of sleeping computers
	
electric sheep is the collective dream of sleeping computers
from all over the internet. less poetically, it is an internet server and
xscreensaver module that displays mpeg video of an animated fractal flame.
in the background, it contributes render cycles to the next animation.
periodically, it uploads completed frames to the server, where they are
compressed for distribution to all clients.
