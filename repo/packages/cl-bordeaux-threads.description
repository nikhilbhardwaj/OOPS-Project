Portable shared-state concurrency for common lisp
	
bordeaux-threads is a proposed standard for a minimal mp/threading interface.

it essentially provides a compatibility layer for multi-threading accross
multiple cl implementations.

some parts of it's implementation-specific code can also be implemented in a
lisp that does not support multiple threads, so that thread-safe code can be
compiled on both multithread and single-thread implementations without need of
conditionals.
