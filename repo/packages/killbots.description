Port of the classic bsd console game robots
	
killbots is a simple game of evading killer robots. the robots are numerous
and their sole objective is to destroy you.  fortunately for you, their
creator has focused on quantity rather than quality and as a result
the robots are severely lacking in intelligence. your superior wit and
a fancy teleportation device are your only weapons against the never-ending
stream of mindless automatons.

this package is part of the kde games module.
