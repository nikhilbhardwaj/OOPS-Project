A pear module to do advanced text maipulations in images
	
image_text provides a comfortable interface to text manipulations in gd
images. beside common freetype2 functionality it offers to handle texts
in a graphic- or office-tool like way. for example it allows alignment of
texts inside a text box, rotation (around the top left corner of a text
box or it's center point) and the automatic measurizement of the optimal
font size for a given text box.
