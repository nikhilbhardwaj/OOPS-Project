Class automation, introspection, and data validation module
	
class::meta provides an interface for automating the creation of perl classes
with attribute data type validation. it differs from other such modules in
that it includes an introspection api that can be used as a unified interface
for all class::meta-generated classes. in this sense, it is an implementation
of the "facade" design pattern.
