Module for creating standard message integrity checks
	
hmac is used for message integrity checks between two parties
that share a secret key, and works in combination with some other
digest algorithm, usually md5 or sha-1.  the hmac mechanism
is described in rfc 2104.

the digest::hmac module follow the common digest:: interface,
but the constructor takes the secret key and the name of some
other simple digest:: module as argument.
