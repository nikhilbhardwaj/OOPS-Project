X.org x server -- nv display driver
	
this driver for the x.org x server (see xserver-xorg for a further description)
provides support for nvidia riva, tnt, geforce, and quadro cards.

note that this is not the same as the binary-only 'nvidia' driver, which
adds 3d support, but is binary-only and not supported.

this package is built from the x.org xf86-video-nv driver module.
