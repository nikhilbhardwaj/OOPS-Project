Orlite extension providing simple statistics
	
orlite::statistics provides easy integration with the statistics::basic set
of modules (see libstatistics-basic-perl). it enables some basic statistical
analysis by generating a vector for a particular method, which can then be
used for any number of things, like determining the median, mean, standard
deviation and other basic descriptive statistics.
