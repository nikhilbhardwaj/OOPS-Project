Ocaml bindings for the mad library (development package)
	
this ocaml library interfaces the mad c library to decode mpeg files.
the mad library currently only supports the mpeg 1 standard, but fully
implements all three audio layers (layer i, layer ii, and layer iii, the
latter often colloquially known as mp3.)

mad has the following special features:

  - 100% fixed-point (integer) computation
  - completely new implementation based on the iso/iec 11172-3 standard
  - distributed under the terms of the gnu general public license (gpl)


this package contains all the development stuff you need to use ocaml-mad
in your programs.
