Dx-cluster tcp/ip client for amateur radio
	
xdx is a client to connect to a dx-cluster. dx messages will be displayed
in a list, announcements will go to a text display.

as well as the usual functions, if you have hamlib installed it can control
the radio and set the frequency simply by double clicking a dx-spot
(using rigctl).
