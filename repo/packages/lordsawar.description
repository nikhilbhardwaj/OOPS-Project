a 2d turn-based strategy game where up to 8 players strive for control
of as many cities as possible.  produce new armies in cities to conquer
nearby cities.  using the income from those cities, make more armies to
take more cities.  send a hero to a temple to get a quest, or maybe search
a nearby ruin instead.  game should run well on modest hardware.
