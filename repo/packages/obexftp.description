File transfer utility for devices that use the obex protocol
	
obex, the object exchange protocol, can best be described as binary http.
obex is optimized for ad-hoc links and can be used to exchange
all kind of objects like files, pictures, calendar entries (vcal)
and business cards (vcard) over bluetooth, irda, usb and serial cable
links.

this is the command line front-end that fully uses the capabilities of
libobexftp.
