Pdp-8 engineering and scientific interpreter extended
	
esi-x was the first stored program scientific interpreter
for the pdp-8.
esi was designed by dave waks on 8/3/66 and was vaguely based on
rand's joss.
in 1967 bob supnik extended the program to support 8kw of memory,
and this became the "esi-extended" or esi-x
focal was eventually the successor of esi-x.
