Postfix policyd to combine complex restrictions in a ruleset
	
postfwd is written in perl to combine complex postfix restrictions in a
ruleset similar to those of the most firewalls. the program uses the postfix
policy delegation protocol to control access to the mail system before a
message has been accepted. it allows you to choose an action (e.g. reject,
dunno) for a combination of several smtp parameters (like sender and recipient
address, size or the client's tls fingerprint).
