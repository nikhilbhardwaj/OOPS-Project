Postgresql data type for storing sets of (key,value) pairs
	
this module is an enhanced version of the hstore type from contrib/hstore,
intended to allow the new features to be used in existing postgresql
versions. (this code is being submitted for inclusion in future versions,
but i have had requests to backport the functionality.)
