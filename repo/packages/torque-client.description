Command line interface to torque server
	
the torque server dispatches jobs across physically separated
machines. it may also be beneficial for single machines to organise
the sequential execution of multiple jobs.

this package contains the command-line client programs. these should
be installed on all hosts that should be able to submit jobs,
query for their status or cancel their execution. the client
contacts the server directly.
