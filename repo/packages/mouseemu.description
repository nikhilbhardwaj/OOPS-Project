Emulate mouse buttons and mouse wheel
	
mouseemu is a daemon to emulate mouse buttons on trackpads
with only one button. it lets you:

 - emulate middle and right click
 - emulate mouse wheel
 - block trackpad while typing


it was initially developed for apple powerbooks
and ibooks, but it may be useful on other architectures
as well.

this program only works when booting a 2.6 kernel because
it uses the new uinput interface to emulate the mouse.
