X11 resource extension library (development headers)
	
libxres provides an x window system client interface to the resource
extension to the x protocol.

the resource extension allows for x clients to see and monitor the x resource
usage of various clients (pixmaps, et al).

this package contains the development headers for the library found in
libxres1.  non-developers likely have little use for this package.
