Documentation for safe library for (pattern match free) functions
	

partial functions from the base library, such as head and !!, modified to
return more descriptive error messages, programmer defined error messages,
maybe wrapped results and default values. these functions can be used to
reduce the number of unsafe pattern matches in your code.

this package contains the library documentation.
