Development files for the c++ computer vision library
	
vision with generic algorithms (vigra) is a computer vision library
that puts its main emphasis on flexible algorithms, because
algorithms represent the principle know-how of this field. the
library was consequently built using generic programming as
introduced by stepanov and musser and exemplified in the c++ standard
template library. by writing a few adapters (image iterators and
accessors) you can use vigra's algorithms on top of your data
structures, within your environment.

this package contains the header and development files needed to
build programs and packages using vigra.
