Vote for your favourite packages automatically
	
the popularity-contest package sets up a cron job that will
periodically anonymously submit to the debian developers
statistics about the most used debian packages on this system.

this information helps debian making decisions such as which packages
should go on the first cd. it also lets debian improve future versions
of the distribution so that the most popular packages are the ones which
are installed automatically for new users.
