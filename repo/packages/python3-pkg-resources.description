Package discovery and resource access using pkg_resources
	
the pkg_resources module provides an api for python libraries to
access their resource files, and for extensible applications and
frameworks to automatically discover plugins.  it also provides
runtime support for using c extensions that are inside zipfile-format
eggs, support for merging packages that have separately-distributed
modules or subpackages, and apis for managing python's current
"working set" of active packages.
