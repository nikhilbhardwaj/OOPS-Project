Network traffic analyzer
	
it is a packet sniffer which runs as a background process and serves its
statistics to a web browser:

 - input and output ip traffic by machines, ports and protocols,
 - last minute, hourly, daily and monthly global input and output graphics.


it is known to be smaller (in terms of memory footprint) and stabler than ntop.
