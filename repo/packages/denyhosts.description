A utility to help sys admins thwart ssh crackers
	
denyhosts is a program that automatically blocks ssh
brute-force attacks by adding entries to /etc/hosts.deny.
it will also inform linux administrators about offending
hosts, attacked users and suspicious logins.

synchronization with a central server is possible too.

differently from other software that do same work, denyhosts
doesn't need support for packet filtering or any other kind
of firewall in your kernel.
