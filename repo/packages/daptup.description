Reporter of changes in list of available packages from repositories
	
daptup runs "apt-get update' inside and then outputs four
lists:

 - packages came to archive with this update;
 - new upgradeable packages;
 - changes in "watched" packages (not installed, such packages have to be
  specified in configuration file);
 - outdated packages that have a new install candidate (optionally).


daptup also has apt hook to run automatically within 'apt-get update' or
'cupt update'.
