Tool to return the body of an email message
	
mailtextbody reads a complete email message on stdin and returns the body
on standard out. -- technically speaking it returns the decoded first
text/plain mime part of any however nested mime message or just the body of
a non-mime message otherwise.

mailtextbody can therefore easily be included in other tools using
pipes.
