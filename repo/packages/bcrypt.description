Cross platform file encryption utility using blowfish
	
bcrypt is a cross platform file encryption utility.  encrypted files are
portable across all supported operating systems and processors.  in addition
to encrypting your data, bcrypt will by default overwrite the original input
file with random garbage three times before deleting it in order to thwart
data recovery attempts by persons who may gain access to your computer.
bcrypt uses the blowfish encryption algorithm published by bruce schneier in
1993.
