Hdaps daemon for ibm/lenovo thinkpads and apple ibooks/powerbooks
	
this is a disk protection user-space daemon. it monitors the acceleration
values through the hdaps or ams interface and automatically initiates disk
head parking if a fall or sliding of the laptop is detected.

it is recommended that you use this daemon with the hdaps module provided
by tp-smapi rather the one in the kernel, as this will save you a bit
power and will work on a wider range of thinkpads.
