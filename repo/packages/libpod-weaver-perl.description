Perl module to weave together a pod document from an outline
	
pod::weaver is a system for building pod documents from templates. it doesn't
perform simple text substitution, but instead builds a
pod::elemental::document. its plugins sketch out a series of sections that
will be produced based on an existing pod document or other provided
information.
