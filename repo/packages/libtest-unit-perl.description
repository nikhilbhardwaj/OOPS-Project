A unit testing framework for perl
	
test::unit::* is a sophisticated unit testing framework for perl
that is derived from the junit testing framework for java by kent
beck and erich gamma.

while this framework is originally intended to support unit
testing in an object-oriented development paradigm (with support
for inheritance of tests etc.), test::unit::procedural is intended
to provide a simpler interface to the framework that is more
suitable for use in a scripting style environment.
