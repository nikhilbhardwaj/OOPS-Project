Edit moinmoin wiki pages with your favourite editor
	
editmoin allows you to edit pages in moinmoin wikis with your
preferred editor instead of the (usually quite limited) web
browser text areas.

it also supports configuration files to define shortcuts for urls
that you edit often.

this package also includes a vim syntax file. install
vim-addon-manager and use "vim-addon install editmoin" to activate.

however, you can use any other editor by setting the standard $editor
environment variable.
