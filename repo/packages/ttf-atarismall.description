Very small 4 x 8 font
	
this is named atari small because it was designed for a terminal emulator
written for an atari 800. it only had a 320 pixel wide display, but an 80
column terminal was wanted, hence there is this font. this is somewhat
cleaned up from the original version. it has only a one pixel descent to
maximize pixels available to the main body of each character.
