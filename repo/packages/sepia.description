Simple emacs-perl interaction
	
sepia is a set of features to make emacs a better tool for perl
development, including:


 * an interactive prompt (repl) for evaluating code;
 * cross-referencing to find and navigate between function and
   variable definitions and uses;
 * variable- and function-name completion.
 * eldoc support to echo function arguments in the minibuffer
 * functions to simplify pod browsing with emacs-w3m
