Perl module to test synopsis code in pods
	
test::synopsis is an (author) test module to find .pm or .pod files
under your lib directory and then make sure the example snippet code in
your synopsis section passes the perl compile check.

note that this module only checks the perl syntax (by wrapping the code
with sub) and doesn't actually run the code.
