Mp3/ogg vorbis broadcast ocaml module
	
this ocaml module implements the protocols used to connect and
send source data to icecast2 and shoutcast servers.

it is a low-level implementation, so it only does the minimal
source connection. in particular, it does not handle synchronisation.
hence, the task of sending audio data to the streaming server
at real time rate is up to the programmer, contrary to the main
implementation, libshout.
