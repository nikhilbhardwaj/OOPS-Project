Moose extension for syntactic sugar in 'has' fields
	
moosex::has::sugar is a module that provides a simple way to avoid quoting
option strings. normally, moose accepts parameters in perl's hash style,
which requires a list of key/value pairs. this module is convenient for
boolean options and to prevent errors with mistyping string values, since
the expressions provided by this module are checked at compile-time.
