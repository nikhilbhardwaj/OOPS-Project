Python interface to the libpcap packet capture library
	
pcapy is a  python extension module that interfaces  with the libpcap
packet capture library.

pcapy enables python scripts to capture packets on the network. pcapy
is highly  effective when used in conjunction  with a packet-handling
package such as impacket, which is a collection of python classes for
constructing and dissecting network packets.
