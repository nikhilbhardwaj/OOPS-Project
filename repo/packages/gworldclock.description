Displays time and date in specified time zones
	
this program displays the time and date of specified time zones using a
gtk+ interface. it also provides a "rendezvous" function allowing the zones
to be synchronised to a time other than the current time. this can help you
organise meetings across different timezones.

the time zones may be entered by hand in tz format or chosen from a list
prepared from /usr/share/zoneinfo/zone.tab.  the zone list is kept in a format
consistent with the shell script tzwatch.
