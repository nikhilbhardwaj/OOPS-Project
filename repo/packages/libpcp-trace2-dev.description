Performance co-pilot application tracing library and headers
	
the libpcp-trace-dev package contains the performance co-pilot (pcp)
library and header files needed to directly instrument an application
for event and value tracking by the pmdatrace(1) pcp trace performance
metric domain agent.

the performance co-pilot provides a unifying abstraction for
all of the interesting performance data in a system, and allows
client applications to easily retrieve and process any subset of
that data.
