Gaming server that emulates battle.net(r)
	
the server currently implements most of the same functionality as the
real battle.net(r) servers from blizzard entertainment.  you can chat,
play games, use / commands, and things like account passwords, user
icons, ad banners, and channel operators work too.  it is by no means
complete, though.

currently starcraft(r), brood war(r), diablo(r), and warcraft(r) ii
bne are supported as clients.
