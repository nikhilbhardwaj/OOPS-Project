Module for testing whether a module is used
	
test::module::used is a perl test module for determining whether a module is
really used (and vice versa) between lib/t and meta.yml. it is useful for
detecting cases where dependencies are specified (possibly as a remnant of
older versions) but no longer needed, or where one forgets to declare them.
