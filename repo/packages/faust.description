Functional programming language for realtime audio applications
	
faust is a functional programming language specifically designed for realtime
audio applications and plugins. the syntax of the language is block diagram
oriented. the faust compiler translate signal processing specifications into
optimized c++ code for signal processing applications.

the generated code can be wrapped into an 'architecture file' in order to
create for example a standalone jack/gtk application. several architecture
