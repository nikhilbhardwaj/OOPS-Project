Gnu r package providing multivariate normal and t distribution
	
this package provides functions for computing the density and the
distribution function of, and for generating random vectors from the
multivariate normal and multivariate t distributions.  it provides
functions similar in scope to those of the package 'mvtnorm', but
with some differences; one of these is that probabilities are
computed via a non-monte carlo method.
