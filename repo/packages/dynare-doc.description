Documentation for dynare
	
dynare is a pre-preprocessor and a collection of gnu octave and
matlab routines which can solve, simulate and estimate non-linear
models with forward looking variables.

in particular, in the field of computational economics, it is used
for solving and estimating dynamic stochastic general equilibrium
(dsge) models.

this package contains full dynare documentation, including a user
guide and the reference manual.
