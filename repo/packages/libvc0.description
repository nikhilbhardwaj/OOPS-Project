Vcard (the electronic business card) library
	
vcard is an electronic business card format, as specified by the
versit consortium, useful for storing personal data.  libvc handles
scanning a vcard file, parsing the vcard file into a data storage
structure, manipulating the data storage structure, and writing back
to file.  it was originally written for `rolo', but has been
split-off as a generic library for general use.
