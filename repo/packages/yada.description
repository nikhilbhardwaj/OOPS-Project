Yet another debianisation aid
	
yada is a debian packaging helper.  it parses a special file,
debian/packages, in a source package, and generates an appropriate
debian/rules to control building of the package.

this package provides yada script.

the /usr/bin/yada script can be also copied as source package's debian/yada
file if this package won't be available on system for package building.
