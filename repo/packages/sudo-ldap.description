Provide limited super user privileges to specific users
	
sudo is a program designed to allow a sysadmin to give limited root
privileges to users and log root activity.  the basic philosophy is to give
as few privileges as possible but still allow people to get their work done.

this version is built with ldap support, which allows an equivalent of the
sudoers database to be distributed via ldap.  authentication is still
performed via pam.
