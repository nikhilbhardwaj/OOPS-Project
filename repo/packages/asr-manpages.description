Alt.sysadmin.recovery manual pages
	
a set of humorous manual pages developed on
alt.sysadmin.recovery (don't treat them seriously!).
they document a set of really useful tools that for some
strange reason are not included in any implementation of
unix. this includes such famous commands as lart, sysadmin,
luser, bosskill and others.
the authors recommend these man pages should be installed
on every system.
