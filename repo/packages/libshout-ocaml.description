Ocaml bindings for the shout library
	
this ocaml library interfaces the shout c library which can be used for
communicating with and sending data to icecast and icecast 2 streaming
audio servers (they currently support ogg vorbis and mp3 audio streams).
it handles the socket connection, the timing of the data transmission,
and prevents bad data from getting to the server.

this package contains only the shared runtime stub libraries.
