Simple tcp re-engineering tool
	
tcpreen is a small tool for monitoring a tcp connection.
it works like a bridge between the server and the client in a tcp
connection, displays any data that is sent either way, and optionally
logs everything to a file.

it is mainly useful if you want to understand what informations a
client and a server exchanges during a tcp session. it was originally
meant to help reverse engineer proprietary tcp-based protocols or
protocol extensions.
