Convert texinfo files to html
	
texi2html is a perl script that converts texinfo files to html.

the program takes texinfo files (not info ones) and produces a set of
html files.  the quality of the output is close to the printed output
and is much better than an info->html gateway.

compared to the output of `makeinfo --html', texi2html's output is
more customizable and (subjectively) produces better output by default.
