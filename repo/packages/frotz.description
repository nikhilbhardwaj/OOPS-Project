Interpreter of z-code story-files
	
frotz interprets z-code story-files, which are usually text adventure
games (although a few arcade-style z-code games have been written).
examples of such story files include the adventure games published by
infocom, as well as any games produced by compilers to this format,
such as inform.  you can find a number of inform-compiled games up for
anonymous ftp at ftp://ftp.ifarchive.org/ or http at http://www.ifarchive.org/

frotz complies with the z machine specification version 1.0.
