Debian patches to version 2.6.32 of the linux kernel
	
this package includes the patches used to produce the prepackaged
linux-source-2.6.32 package, as well as architecture-specific patches.

note that these patches do not apply against a pristine linux 2.6.32
kernel but only against the kernel tarball linux-2.6_2.6.32.orig.tar.gz
from the debian archive.
