Javastation prom 2.x compatible replacement
	
proll is a 2.x prom compatible replacement for javastations, that can
be used on emulators such as qemu or to make possible to boot linux, as
later 3.x series of the proms are unable to boot it.

javastations came with two different proms installed in them. version 2.30
shipped with the earliest mr. coffee models, that was updated by latter
versions of the sun netra j software environment to 3.11. krups and
espresso came with 3.x versions of the prom by default.
