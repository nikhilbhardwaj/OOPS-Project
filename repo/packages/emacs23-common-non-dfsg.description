Gnu emacs shared, architecture independent, non-dfsg items
	
gnu emacs is the extensible self-documenting text editor.  this
package contains the architecture independent infrastructure that is
not compliant with the debian free software guidelines.  in
particular, this includes some of the gnu emacs info pages, as they
are covered under the gfdl, and they specify invariant sections.
