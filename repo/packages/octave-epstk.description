Gnu octave encapsulated postscript toolkit
	
the octave-epstk package provides, via a set of .m functions, a toolkit to
create powerful encapsulated postscript (.eps) graphs. most 2d scientific
graphics functions are written. the generated .eps-files are very small and
can be imported into other documents without loss of quality.
