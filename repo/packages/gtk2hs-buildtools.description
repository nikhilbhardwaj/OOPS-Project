Tools to build the gtk2hs suite of user interface libraries
	
this package provides a set of helper programs necessary to build the gtk2hs
suite of libraries. these tools include a modified c2hs binding tool that is
used to generate ffi declarations, a tool to build a type hierarchy that
mirrors the c type hierarchy of gobjects found in glib, and a generator for
signal declarations that are used to call back from c to haskell. these tools
are not needed to actually run gtk2hs programs.
