Tao cli binding for ffmpeg - development files
	
the tao framework is a collection of bindings and libraries to
facilitate cross-platform games-related development utilizing the mono
and .net platforms.

the ffmpeg libraries support most existing file formats (avi, mpeg, ogg,
matroska, asf...) and encoding formats (mpeg, divx, mpeg4, ac3, dv...).

this package contains development files for tao.ffmpeg, and should be
used for compilation.
