Nodes builder for doom-style games; has support for opengl
	
glbsp is a node builder specially designed to be used with opengl ports of
the doom game engine. it adheres to the "gl-friendly nodes" specification,
which means it adds some new special nodes to a wad file that makes it very
easy (and fast!) for an opengl doom engine to compute the polygons needed
for drawing the levels.

there are many doom ports that understand the gl nodes which glbsp creates,
including edge, the doomsday engine (jdoom), doom3d, prboom, and vavoom.
