kwalletcli implements a command line interface tool to get and set
password entries in the default kde wallet. also included are a shell
wrapper around pinentry, a pinentry-kwallet application checking the
kde wallet for the passphrase requested before asking the user for
use with the gnupg agent, which is also capable of running without
a pinentry as backend, and kwalletaskpass, which can store ssh key
passphrases in the kde wallet for use with the openssh agent.
