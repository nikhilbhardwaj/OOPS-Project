Lightweight stream download utility
	
icecream is a non-interactive stream download utility written in perl.
it connects to icecast and shoutcast servers or direct stream urls, and
redirects all fetched content to stdout and/or to media files on your disk.

listen to the stream piping the output to a stdin-capable media player.
save the stream to a named file or split it into different tracks.
it is possible to redirect the stream and save it to disk at the same time.
