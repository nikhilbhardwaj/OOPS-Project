Network audio system - client binaries
	
the network audio system (nas) was developed by ncd for playing,
recording, and manipulating audio data over a network. like the x
window system, it uses the client/server model to separate
applications from the specific drivers that control audio input and
output devices.

this package contains the example applications and utilities that are
provided with nas.
