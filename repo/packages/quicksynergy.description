Gui for easy configuration of synergy
	
quicksynergy is a graphical interface (gui) for easily configuring synergy,
an application that allows the user to share their mouse and keyboard between
two or more computers.

without the need for any external hardware, synergy uses the tcp-ip protocol
to share the resources, even between machines with different operating
systems, such as mac os, linux and windows.
