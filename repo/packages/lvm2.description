The linux logical volume manager
	
this is lvm2, the rewrite of the linux logical volume manager.  lvm
supports enterprise level volume management of disk and disk subsystems
by grouping arbitrary disks into volume groups. the total capacity of
volume groups can be allocated to logical volumes, which are accessed as
regular block devices.
