Library for reading and writing windows registry hives
	
libhivex is a self-contained library for reading and writing windows
registry "hive" binary files.

unlike many other tools in this area, it doesn't use the textual .reg
format for output, because parsing that is as much trouble as parsing
the original binary format. instead it makes the file available
through a c api, or there is a separate program to export the hive as
xml.
