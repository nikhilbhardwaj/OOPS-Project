Convert text file line endings between crlf and lf
	
this package includes two utilities to handle conversion of the text
file line ending: dos2unix and mac2unix. the text files stored under
windows and dos typically have two ascii characters at the end: the
cr followed by lf code. the unix and linux store text files ending
only to lf and older macs stored the files ending to cr. while modern
editors can read any one of them, there may be need to convert files
to one format or another.
this is the classic utility developed 1989.
