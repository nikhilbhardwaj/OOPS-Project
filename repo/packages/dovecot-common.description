Secure mail server that supports mbox and maildir mailboxes
	
dovecot is a mail server whose major goals are security and extreme
reliability. it tries very hard to handle all error conditions and verify
that all data is valid, making it nearly impossible to crash. it should
also be pretty fast, extensible, and portable.

this package contains the files used by both the dovecot imap and pop3 servers
and the dovecot lda (deliver).
