Pure perl interface to ogg vorbis information fields
	
ogg::vorbis::header::pureperl is an object-oriented interface to ogg vorbis
information and comment fields, implemented entirely in perl. intended to be a
drop in replacement for ogg::vobis::header.

unlike ogg::vorbis::header, this module will go ahead and fill in all of the
information fields as soon as you construct the object. in other words, the new
and load constructors have identical behavior.
