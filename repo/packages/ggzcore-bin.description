Ggz gaming zone: various command-line helper programs
	
there are two helper tools provided with ggz:

the developer utility ggz-config manages the database of game clients
and allows developers to query ggz parameters.

with ggz-wrapper it is possible to let any program connect to a ggz
server, communicating with standard input/output channels.  this is used
by the ggz plugins for instant messengers.

this package is part of the ggz gaming zone, a multiuser networked
gaming environment.
