Gpg passphrase agent based on gnome keyring
	
gnome-gpg is a command-line wrapper around gpg which neatly integrates
passphrase caching with gnome's keyring agent and user interface.

having supplied the passphrase for your key once, it is kept
in memory for a finite time to save typing it again. this better
protects your keys by making it less inconvenient to use a complex
passphrase.
