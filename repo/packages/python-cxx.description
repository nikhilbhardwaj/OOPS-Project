A set of facilities to extend python with c++
	
pycxx is a set of c++ facilities to make it easier to write python
extensions.  the chief way in which pycxx makes it easier to write
python extensions is that it greatly increases the probability that
your program will not make a reference-counting error and will not
have to continually check error returns from the python c api.
