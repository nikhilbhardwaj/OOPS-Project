Multiple precision complex floating-point library
	
mpc is a portable library written in c for arbitrary precision
arithmetic on complex numbers providing correct rounding. for the time
being, it contains all arithmetic operations over complex numbers, the
exponential and the logarithm functions, the trigonometric and
hyperbolic functions.

ultimately, it should implement a multiprecision equivalent of the iso
c99 standard.

it builds upon the gnu mp and the mpfr libraries.
