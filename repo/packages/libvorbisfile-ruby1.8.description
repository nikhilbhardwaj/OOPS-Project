Ogg vorbis support library for ruby
	
libvorbisfile-ruby is a decoder library provided with the ogg vorbis
distribution. see http://xiph.org/ogg/vorbis/ for details.

the api of this extension is virtually identical to that of
vorbisfile.h, with a couple of exceptions:


 * prefixes have been removed (ov_open -> open).
 * the oggvorbis_file parameter is removed, as the vorbisfile object
   encapsulates this.
