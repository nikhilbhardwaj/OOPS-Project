Decentralized model-based administration tool
	
deets provides a way to manage debian packages and files
on your systems using lua-based configuration files.  a
specialized lua interpreter called luau is capable of
validating your specifications and optionally enforcing
them.

in addition, it can scan your system and generate a
crude model configuration based on the current state
of the debian package database and all conffiles.
