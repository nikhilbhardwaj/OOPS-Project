A library to use maven's artifact handling features from ant
	
the mavent ant tasks allow several of maven's artifact handling features to
be used from within an ant build. these include:


  * dependency management - including transitive dependencies, scope
    recognition and snapshot handling.
  * artifact deployment - deployment to a maven repository (file integrated,
    other with extensions)
  * pom processing - for reading and writing a maven 2 pom.xml file.
