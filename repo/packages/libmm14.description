Shared memory library - runtime
	
ossp mm is a two layer abstraction library which simplifies the use of
shared memory between forked (and therefore closely related) processes.
it hides all platform-dependent aspects of the process from the user
and provides a malloc(3)-style api.

this package contains the runtime libraries required to run programs
dynamically linked against mm.
