Converts metafont fonts into type1 fonts
	
mftrace is a small python program that lets you trace a tex bitmap
font (a metafont font) into a pfa or pfb font (a postscript type1
scalable font).

type1 fonts offer many advantages over bitmaps, as they allow
postscript files to render correctly on printers with many resolutions.
moreover, ghostscript can generate much better pdf, if given scalable
fonts.
