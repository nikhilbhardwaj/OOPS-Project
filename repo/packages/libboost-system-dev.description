Operating system (e.g. diagnostics support) library (default version)
	
this package forms part of the boost c++ libraries collection.

the boost system library provides simple, light-weight error_code
objects that encapsulate system-specific error code values, yet also
provide access to more abstract and portable error conditions via
error_condition objects. because error_code objects can represent
errors from sources other than the operating system, including
user-defined sources, each error_code and error_condition has an
associated error_category.

this package is a dependency package, which depends on debian's default
boost version (currently 1.42).
