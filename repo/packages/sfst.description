Stuttgart finite-state transducer tools
	
sfst is a toolbox for the implementation of morphological analysers
and other tools which are based on finite state transducer
technology. the sfst tools comprise


  * a compiler which translates transducer programs into minimised transducers
  * interactive and batch-mode analysis programs
  * tools for comparing and printing transducers
  * a c++ library which is efficient and easy to use
