An automated system for building latex documents
	
this is a building system for latex documents. it is based on a routine that
runs just as many compilations as necessary. the module system provides a
great flexibility that virtually allows support for any package with no user
intervention, as well as pre- and post-processing of the document. the
standard modules currently provide support for bibtex, dvips, dvipdfm,
pdftex, makeindex. a good number of standard packages are supported,
including graphics/graphicx with automatic conversion between various
graphics formats and metapost compilation.
