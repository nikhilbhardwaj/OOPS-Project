Performance co-pilot graphical client tools library and headers
	
the libpcp-gui-dev package contains the performance co-pilot (pcp)
library and header files needed to incorporate graphical time control
(pmtime) into a monitoring application.

the performance co-pilot provides a unifying abstraction for
all of the interesting performance data in a system, and allows
client applications to easily retrieve and process any subset of
that data.
