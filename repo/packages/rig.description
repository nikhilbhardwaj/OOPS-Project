Random identity generator
	
rig (random identity generator) is a free replacement for a shareware
program out there called 'fake'. it generates random, yet real-looking,
personal data. it is useful if you need to feed a name to a web site,
bbs, or real person, and are too lazy to think of one yourself. also,
if the web site/bbs/person you are giving the information to tries to
cross-check the city, state, zip, or area code, it will check out.
