Vmcore extraction tool - static binary
	
this program is used to extract a subset of the memory available either
via /dev/mem or /proc/vmcore (for crashdumps). it is used to get memory
images without extra uneeded information (zero pages, userspace programs,
etc).

this version is statically linked, so that it can be used in an
initramfs or other environment where not all libraries are available.
