Perl module to parse a string containing fixed length fields
	
the parse::fixedlength module facilitates the process of breaking
a string into its fixed-length components. sure, it's a glorified
(and in some ways more limited) substitute for the perl functions pack and
unpack, but this module helps in the maintainability of working with fixed
length formats as the number of fields in a format grows.
