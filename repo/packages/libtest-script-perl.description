Perl test module for scripts
	
test::script is a perl module that provides a series of basic tests for those
files usually found in the bin or scripts directory of your package. it aims
to provide your scripts with perfect platform-compatability and in a way that
is as unobstrusive as possible. the general idea is that if a program works
on a platform, then test::script tests should also pass on that platform.
