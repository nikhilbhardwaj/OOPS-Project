Report upon packages of cpan distributions
	
cpan consists of distributions. however, cpan is not an isolated
system - distributions are also packaged in other places, such as for
operating systems. this module reports whether cpan distributions are
packaged for various operating systems, and which version they have.

note: only cpan, debian, fedora, freebsd, gentoo, mandrake, openbsd and
suse are currently supported. i want to support everything else.
patches are welcome.
