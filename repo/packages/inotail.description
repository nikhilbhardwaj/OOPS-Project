Tail replacement using inotify
	
inotail is a replacement for the 'tail' program which is used to output the
last portions of a file. it makes use of the inotify infrastructure in recent
versions of the linux kernel to speed up tailing files in the follow
mode (the '-f' option). ancient versions of tail poll the file every second by
default while inotail (and tail from the gnu coreutils as of version 7.5)
listens to special events sent by the kernel through the inotify api to
determine whether a file needs to be reread.
