Reliable event logging protocol (relp) library - development files
	
relp provides reliable event logging over the network.

relp (and hence) librelp assures that no message is lost, not even when
connections break and a peer becomes unavailable. the current version of
relp has a minimal window of opportunity for message duplication after a
session has been broken due to network problems. in this case, a few messages
may be duplicated (a problem that also exists with plain tcp syslog). future
versions of relp will address this shortcoming.

please note that relp is a general-purpose, extensible logging protocol. even
though it was designed to solve the urgent need of rsyslog-to-rsyslog
communication, relp supports many more applications. extensible command verbs
provide ample opportunity to extend the protocol without affecting existing
applications.
