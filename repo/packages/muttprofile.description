A utility to choose profiles in mutt
	
a profile in mutt is simply a specific subset of the configuration. you may
have a personal and a work profile, each of which uses the same base
configuration and then overrides specific configuration items like the email
address.

muttprofile gives an easy way to switch between such profiles from within
a running instance of mutt. quite simple and quite beautiful, and implemented
in perl.
