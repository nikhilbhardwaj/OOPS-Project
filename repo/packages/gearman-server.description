Gearman distributed job server and perl interface
	
gearman is a system to farm out work to other machines, dispatching function
calls to machines that are better suited to do work, to do work in parallel,
to load balance lots of function calls, or even to call functions between
languages.

this package contains both the gearman server as well as the corresponding
perl bindings.
