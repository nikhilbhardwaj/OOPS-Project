Introspection of many-to-many dbix::class relationships
	
because dbix::class many-to-many relationships are not actual relationships,
they cannot be introspected with dbix::class.  they are actually just a
collection of convenience  methods that bridge two actual relationships.

dbix::class::introspectablem2m can be used to store all relevant information
about these m2m relationships so they can later be introspected and examined.
