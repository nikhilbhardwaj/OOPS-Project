Ncurses-based player for spectrum '.ay' music files
	
aylet plays music files in the `.ay' format. these files are
essentially wrappers around bits of z80 code which play music on the
sinclair zx spectrum 128's sound hardware - either the beeper, or
(eponymously) the ay-3-8912 sound chip. files using the amstrad cpc
ports are also supported.

one source of `.ay' files playable with aylet is "project ay"
on the world of spectrum website:
