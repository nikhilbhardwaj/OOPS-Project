Perl module for secure sockets layer (ssl)
	
net::ssleay.pm is a perl module that allows you to call secure sockets
layer (ssl) functions of the ssleay library directly from your perl
scripts. it is useful if you want to program robots that access secure web
servers or if you want to build your own applications over ssl encrypted
tunnels. if you just want to view web pages on https servers, you do not
need this - your web browser already knows to do that.
