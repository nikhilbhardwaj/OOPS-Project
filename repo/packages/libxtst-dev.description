X11 record extension library (development headers)
	
libxtst provides an x window system client interface to the record
extension to the x protocol.

the record extension allows x clients to synthesise input events, which
is useful for automated testing.

this package contains the development headers for the library found in
libxtst6.  non-developers likely have little use for this package.
