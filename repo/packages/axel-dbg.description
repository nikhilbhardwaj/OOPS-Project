Light download accelerator - debugging symbols
	
axel tries to accelerate the downloading process by using multiple connections
for one file.  it can also use multiple mirrors for one download.  axel tries
to be as light as possible (25-30k in binary form), so it might be useful as a
wget clone on byte-critical systems.

this package contains the debugging symbols for axel.
