Perl module for really clean programs
	
the first time you run a program under use acme::bleach, the module removes all
the unsightly printable characters from your source file.

this package also installs the acme::dwim and acme::morse modules. acme::dwim
replaces all the unsightly operators et al. from your source file with the new
dwim operator: ... (pronounced "yadda yadda yadda"). acme::morse converts your
program to morse code.
