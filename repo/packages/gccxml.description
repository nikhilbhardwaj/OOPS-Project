Xml output extension to gcc
	
there is one open-source c++ parser, the c++ front-end to gcc, which
is currently able to deal with the language in its entirety. the
purpose of the gcc-xml extension is to generate an xml description of
a c++ program from gcc's internal representation. since xml is easy to
parse, other development tools will be able to work with c++ programs
without the burden of a complicated c++ parser.
