Style checker for source code
	
kwstyle is integrated in the software process to ensure that the code written
by several users is consistent and can be viewed/printed as it was written by
one person.

kwstyle is primarily checking c/c++ source code but can be easily extended to
other languages. it assumes that the code is syntaxically correct, i.e it
compiles on a standard compiler.
