Java implementation of openbsd's blowfish hashing
	
jbcrypt is an implementation of blowfish block cipher with modifications
designed to raise the cost of off-line password cracking and frustrate fast
hardware implementation.

the intent is to make a compromise of a password database less likely to
result in an attacker gaining knowledge of the plaintext passwords (e.g. using
john the ripper).
