Portable midi sequencer engine in c++ - development files
	
tse3 is a portable open source midi sequencer engine written in c++.
it provides programmers with rich and powerful sequencing
capabilities.  although it does not provide a user interface, it
provides a lot of assistance to a ui, attempting to provide as much
functionality as possible in as generic a manner as possible.

this package provides the shared library libtse3, which is required
in order to run programs linked against tse3.
