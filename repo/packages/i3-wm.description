An improved dynamic tiling window manager
	
key features of i3 are good support of multi-monitor setups (workspaces are
assigned to virtual screens, i3 does the right thing when attaching new
monitors), xrandr support, horizontal and vertical columns (think of a table)
in tiling. also, special focus is on writing clean, readable and well
documented code. i3 uses xcb for asynchronous communication with x11, and has
several measures to be very fast.

please be aware i3 is primarily targeted at advanced users and developers.
