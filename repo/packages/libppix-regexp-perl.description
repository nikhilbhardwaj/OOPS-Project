Perl module to parse regular expressions
	
ppix::regexp is a perl module designed to parse regular expressions in a
manner similar to the way that ppi parsers perl documents. this class forms
the root of the parse tree, playing a role similar to ppi::document. like
ppi, this module produces output which is round-trip safe.
