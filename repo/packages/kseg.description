Sketchpad for planar euclidean geometry
	
kseg allows you to interactively create a geometrical construction,
similar to what you can do with a straight edge and compass.  points
may be inserted on the page with right mouse-button clicks, and then
used to form segments, lines, circles, or other geometrical objects.
at any time you can drag existing points around, and watch how the
constructed objects respond.
