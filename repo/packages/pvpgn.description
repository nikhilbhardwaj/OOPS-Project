Gaming server that emulates battle.net(r)
	
the server currently implements most of the same functionality as the
real battle.net(r) servers from blizzard entertainment.  you can chat,
play games, use / commands, and things like account passwords, user
icons, ad banners, and channel operators work too.  it is by no means
complete, though.
