Perl module for subroutine signatures with no source filter
	
with signatures, you can specify subroutine signatures and have
variables automatically defined within the subroutine. note that,
although the syntax is very similar, the signatures provided by this
module are not to be confused with the prototypes described in
perlsub. all this module does is extracting items of @_ and assigning
them to the variables in the parameter list. no argument validation
is done at runtime.
