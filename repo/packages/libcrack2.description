Pro-active password checker library
	
shared library for cracklib2 which contains a c function which may be
used in a passwd like program. the idea is simple: try to prevent
users from choosing passwords that could be guessed by crack by
filtering them out, at source. cracklib2 is not a replacement passwd
program. cracklib2 is a library.
