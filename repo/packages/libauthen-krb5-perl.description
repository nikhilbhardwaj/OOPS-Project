authen::krb5 is a perl module providing an object-oriented interface to the
kerberos 5 api. it rearranges the api slightly to provide an object-oriented
view, but otherwise closely matches the c interface. use may require previous
experience with kerberos 5 programming or reference to the kerberos 5 api
documentation.

this package is built against the mit kerberos 5 libraries.
