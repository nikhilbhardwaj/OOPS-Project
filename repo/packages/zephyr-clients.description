Project athena's notification service - client programs
	
zephyr is derived from the original project athena 'instant message' system
and allows users to send messages to other users or to groups of users.
users can view incoming zephyr messages as windowgrams (transient x
windows) or as text on a terminal.

this package provides client programs for the messaging service.
