Compression program for large files
	
rzip is a compression program able to take advantage of
long distance redundancies in files, allowing greater
compression ratios.  rzip uses a history buffer of up to
900mb, while gzip uses 32kb and bzip2 uses 900kb.  rzip
cannot read from the standard input or write to the
standard output.
