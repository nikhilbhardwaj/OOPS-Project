Sat solver with proof and core support
	
despite the np completeness of the satisfiabilty problem of boolean formulas
(sat), sat solvers are often able to decide this problem in a reasonable time
frame. as all other np complete problems are reducible to sat, the solvers
have become a general purpose tool for this class of problems.

picosat is a sat solver that turned out to be faster on industrial instances
than minisat 2.0 and also can generate proofs and cores in memory.
