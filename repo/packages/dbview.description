View dbase iii files
	
dbview is a little tool that will display dbase iii and iv
files. you can also use it to convert your old .dbf files
for further use with unix.

it wasn't the intention to write a freaking viewer and
reinvent the wheel again. instead dbview is intend to be
used in conjunction with your favourite unix text utilities
like cut, recode and more.
