Moose role for turning objects into poe sessions
	
poex::role::sessioninstantiation is a moose role that can support nearly
seamless integration for non-poe objects in a poe environment. it does this
by handling the poe stuff behind the scenes including allowing per-instance
method changes, session registration to the kernel, and providing defaults
like setting an alias if supplied via the attribute or constructor argument,
or defining a _default that warns if your object receives an event that it
does not have. this role exposes your class' methods as poe events.
