`user services' - program call across trust boundaries
	
userv allows one program to invoke another when only limited trust
exists between them.  it is a tool which can be used to avoid having
to give other system services root privilege, and which allows users
to more securely have programs provide services to others.

userv can be useful as `glue' for system administrators; there are
not many full-blown userv-using applications yet.
