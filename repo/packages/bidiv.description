Bidi viewer - command-line tool displaying logical hebrew/arabic
	
bidiv is a simple utility for converting logical-hebrew input to visual-hebrew
output. this is useful for reading hebrew mail messages, viewing hebrew texts,
etc. it was written for hebrew but arabic (or other bidi languages) should
work equally well.
