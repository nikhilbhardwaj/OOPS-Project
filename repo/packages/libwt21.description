C++ library and application server for web applications [runtime]
	
wt (pronounced 'witty') is a c++ library and application server for
developing and deploying web applications. the api is widget-centric
and offers complete abstraction of any web-specific application details.

this package contains the wt core library but you still need to install
a connector, either the http connector (libwthttp) or the fastcgi
connector (libwtfcgi).
