Strongswan internet key exchange (v1) daemon
	
strongswan is an ipsec-based vpn solution for the linux kernel. it uses the
native ipsec stack and runs on any recent 2.6 kernel (no patching required).
it supports both ikev1 and the newer ikev2 protocols.

pluto is an ipsec ikev1 daemon. it was inherited from the frees/wan
project, but provides improved x.509 certificate support and other features.

pluto can run in parallel with charon, the newer ikev2 daemon.
