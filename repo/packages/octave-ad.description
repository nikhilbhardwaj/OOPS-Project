Automatic forward differentiation in octave
	
automatic differentiation (ad) is a technique to analytically compute
the derivative of a function at a given inner point of its domain.
it overcomes the accuracy and efficiency problems related to the
method of finite differences.  this package implements the ad
algorithms in octave, a numerical computation software.

this octave add-on package is part of the octave-forge project.
