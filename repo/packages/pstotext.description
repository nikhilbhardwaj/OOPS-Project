Extract text from postscript and pdf files
	
pstotext extracts text (in the iso 8859-1 character set) from a postscript
or pdf (portable document format) file. thus, pstotext is similar to the
ps2ascii program that comes with ghostscript. the output of pstotext is
however better than that of ps2ascii, because pstotext deals better with
punctuation and ligatures.
