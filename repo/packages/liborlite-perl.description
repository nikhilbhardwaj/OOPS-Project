Lightweight sqlite-specific orm
	
orlite is a perl module that implements an object-relational mapper designed
specifically for sqlite. it follows many of the same principles as the ::tiny
series of modules and has a design that aligns directly to the capabilities
of sqlite.

orlite discovers the schema of a sqlite database, and then deploys a set of
packages for talking to that database.
