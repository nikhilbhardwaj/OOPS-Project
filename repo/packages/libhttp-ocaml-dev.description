Ocaml library for writing http servers
	
ocaml http is a library for the objective caml programming language,
used to build simple http servers, largely inspired to perl's
http::daemon module.

in order to implement an http servers the programmer has to provide a
daemon specification which contains, among other parameters, a callback
function invoked by ocaml http on well formed http requests received.
http responses could be sent over an out_channel connected with client
socket, accessible from the callback.

the library contains also facility functions that helps in creating
well formed http responses and a tiny http client.
