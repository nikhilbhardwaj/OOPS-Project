Secure shell server for the debian installer
	
this is the portable version of openssh, a free implementation of
the secure shell protocol as specified by the ietf secsh working
group.

this package provides the sshd server for use in debian-installer.
since it is expected to be used in specialized situations (e.g. s/390
installs with no console), it does not provide any configuration.
