X11 miscellaneous utility library headers
	
libxmu and libxmuu are miscellaneous utility libraries for x library
developers to abstract some common functions.  this package provides the
headers for both libraries (as libxmuu is a subset of libxmu), and
is depended upon by both.  for more information, please see libxmu-dev or
libxmuu-dev.
