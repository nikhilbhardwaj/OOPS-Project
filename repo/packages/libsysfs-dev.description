Interface library to sysfs - development files
	
sysfs is a virtual file system in linux kernel 2.5+ that provides a
tree of system devices. libsysfs provides a stable programming
interface to sysfs and eases querying system devices and their
attributes.

this package provides everything that is needed for developing own
programs using libsysfs: c headers, a static library, documentation
and example programs.
