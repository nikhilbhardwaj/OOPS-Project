Xs based css minifier
	
css::minifier::xs is a css "minifier"; its designed to remove un-necessary
whitespace and comments from css files, while also not breaking the css.

css::minifier::xs is similar in function to css::minifier, but is
substantially faster as its written in xs and not just pure perl.
