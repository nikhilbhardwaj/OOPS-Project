Whois client interface for perl5
	
the net::xwhois class provides a generic client framework for doing
whois queries and parsing server response.

one of the more important goals of this module is to enable the
design of consistent and predictable interfaces to incompatible
whois response formats. the whois rfc (954) does not define a
template for presenting server data; consequently there is a large
variation in layout styles as well as content served across
servers.
