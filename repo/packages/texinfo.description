Documentation system for on-line information and printed output
	
texinfo is a documentation system that uses a single source file to
produce both on-line information and printed output.

using texinfo, you can create a printed document with the normal features
of a book, including chapters, sections, cross references, and indices.
from the same texinfo source file, you can create a menu-driven, on-line
info file with nodes, menus, cross references, and indices.
