the sendmail mail filter api (milter) is designed to allow third-party
programs access to mail messages as they are being processed in order
to filter meta-information (headers) and content.

the debian sendmail package is built to support libmilter.

this is the libmilter static library and include files for development.

the documentation on building a milter is in the sendmail-doc package.
