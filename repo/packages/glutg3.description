The opengl utility toolkit
	
glut (as in ``gluttony'') is a window system independent toolkit for
writing opengl programs.  it implements a simple windowing api, which
makes life considerably easier when learning about and exploring opengl
programming.

this package has been replaced by `freeglut3'.
