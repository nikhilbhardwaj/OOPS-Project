Gnu privacy guard - signature verification tool
	
gnupg is gnu's tool for secure communication and data storage.

gpgv is a stripped-down version of gnupg which is only able to check
signatures.  it is smaller than the full-blown gnupg and uses a
different (and simpler) way to check that the public keys used to
make the signature are trustworthy.
