Mailing list manager
	
enemies of carlotta is a simple manager for mailing lists that mimics the
ezmlm (http://www.ezmlm.org/) mail commands, but does not rely on qmail
to work.

supports english, finnish, french, spanish, and swedish: messages the list
manager sends are in one of these languages. language is configurable
per list.
