Music player daemon controlled from the gnome panel or cli
	
quark is an audio player, for geeks, by geeks. it runs in the
background with access provided via a fifo in the filesystem. it uses
xine-lib for playing music, and can therefore play any file format
supported by xine.

quark comes with a couple front-ends to make it more useful:

 * charm-quark - a cli interface
 * strange-quark - a gnome notification area interface.
