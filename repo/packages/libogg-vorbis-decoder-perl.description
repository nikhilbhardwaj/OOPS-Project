Object-oriented ogg vorbis decoder
	
ogg::vorbis::decoder provides users with decoder objects for ogg
vorbis files.

one can read data in pcm format from the stream, seek by raw bytes,
pcm samples, or time, and gather decoding-specific information not
provided by ogg::vorbis::header.  currently, no support is provided for
the callback mechanism provided by the vorbisfile api; this may be
included in future releases.
