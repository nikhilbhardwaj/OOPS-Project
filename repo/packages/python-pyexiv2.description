Python binding to exiv2
	
pyexiv2 is a python binding to eiv2, the c++ library for manipulation
of exif and iptc image metadata. it is a python module that allows your
python scripts to read and write metadata (exif, iptc, thumbnail)
embedded in image files (jpeg, tiff, ...).

it is designed as a high level interface to the functionalities offered
by exiv2 (and is built on top of it). using python's built-in data
types and standard modules, it provides easy manipulation of image
metadata.
