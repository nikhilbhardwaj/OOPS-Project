Multimedia rtsp streaming library
	
the live555.com streaming media code is a set of c++ libraries for multimedia
streaming, using open standard protocols (rtp/rtcp, rtsp, sip). these
libraries can be used to build applications to stream, receive and process
mpeg, h.263+ or jpeg video, several audio codecs, and can easily be extended
to support additional codecs. they can also be used to build basic rtsp (real
time streaming protocol) or sip (session initiation protocol) clients and
servers.

this package contains the headers and static libraries required to build
applications that use live555.com.
