Gtk+ frontend for most used compression formats
	
xarchiver is a desktop environment independent gtk+ 2 frontend for manipulating
7z, arj, bzip2, gzip, rar, tar, zip, and rpm files. it allows you to create
archives and add, extract, and delete files from them. password protected
archives in the arj, 7z, rar, and zip formats are supported.

xarchiver uses library package routines, if available. if you need even more
package formats, try xarchive which uses shell scripts.
