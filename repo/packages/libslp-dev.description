service location protocol is an ietf standard protocol that is used to
discover/advertise services on the network. you can use slp for anything
from locating a suitable printer on your floor to discovering what ldap
directories are available in your organization. this package allows
development of slp applications using the openslp libraries. it includes
headers, libraries and links to allow static and dynamic linking. it also
includes slptool, a utility to test service advertisement/lookup. the
library implements rfc 2614 - an api for service location.
