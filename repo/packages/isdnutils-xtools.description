Isdn utilities - graphical tools
	
this package provides xmonisdn and xisdnload, which are graphical tools
for isdn. each in its own way gives a visual indication of the status of
the isdn lines, so that (for example) it is obvious when there is a
connection.

they have been split out into a separate package to allow the others
in the suite to avoid dependencies on the x window system.
