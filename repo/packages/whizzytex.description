A wysiwyg emacs environment for latex
	
whizzytex is an emacs minor mode for incrementally
(texing and) previewing a latex file while editing at real-time.

it works with ghostview-based and xdvi-based previewers,
but enhanced visual effects and wider variety of options
will be available when using the advi dvi-previewer.
