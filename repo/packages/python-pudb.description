Full-screen, console-based python debugger
	
pudb is a full-screen, console-based visual debugger for python.

its goal is to provide all the niceties of modern gui-based debuggers
in a more lightweight and keyboard-friendly package. pudb allows you
to debug code right where you write and test it -- in a terminal. if
you've worked with the excellent (but nowadays ancient) dos-based
turbo pascal or c tools, pudb's ui might look familiar.
