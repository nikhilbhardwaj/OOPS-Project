Mime and rfc822 parser for java
	
mime4j provides a parser, mimestreamparser, for e-mail message streams in
plain rfc822 and mime format. the parser uses a callback mechanism to report
parsing events such as the start of an entity header, the start of a body,
etc.

problem getting started with mime4j.
