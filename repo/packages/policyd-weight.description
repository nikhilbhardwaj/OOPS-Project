A perl policy daemon for the postfix mta
	
its intended to eliminate forged envelope senders and helos (i.e. in bogus
mails). it allows you to score dnsbls (rbl/rhsbl), helo, mail from and client
ip addresses before any queuing is done. it allows you to reject messages
which have a score higher than allowed, providing improved blocking of spam
and virus mails. policyd-weight caches the most frequent client/sender
combinations (spam as well as ham) to reduce the number of dns queries.
