Simulation open framework architecture - runtime
	
sofa is an open source framework primarily targeted at
real-time simulation, with an emphasis on medical simulation.
it is mostly intended for the research community to help
develop newer algorithms, but can also be used as an efficient
prototyping tool.

this package contains the libraries needed to run sofa applications.
