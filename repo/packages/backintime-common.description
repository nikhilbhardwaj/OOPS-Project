Simple backup/snapshot system
	
back in time is a framework for rsync, diff and cron for the purpose of
taking snapshots and backups of specified folders. it minimizes disk space use
by taking a snapshot only if the directory has been changed, and hard links
for unmodified files if it has. the user can schedule regular backups using
cron.

this is the common framework for back in time. you need to choose a suitable
front-end for your desktop environment, like backintime-gnome or
backintime-kde.
