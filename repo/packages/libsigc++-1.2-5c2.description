Type-safe signal framework for c++ - runtime
	
this library implements a full callback system for use in widget
libraries, abstract interfaces, and general programming. it provides
the ability to connect an abstract callback to a class method,
function, or function object, and contains adaptor classes for
connection of dissimilar callbacks.

these are the runtime files for libsigc++, needed only if you wish to
run software which depends on it.
