2d dogfight game in the tradition of 'biplanes' and 'bip'
	
airstrike is a 2d dogfight game in the tradition of the intellivision and
amiga games 'biplanes' and 'bip'. it features a robust physics engine and
several other extensions of the original games. it is currently 0-2 player
only, but will hopefully have network play and some more advanced computer
controlled enemies in the future. the graphics have been created using the
povray raytracer, and should be easy to extend and modify.

this package contains the architecture-independent data files.
