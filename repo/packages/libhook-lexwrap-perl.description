Lexically scoped subroutine wrappers
	
hook::lexwrap allows you to install a pre- or post-wrapper (or both)
around an existing subroutine. unlike other modules that provide this
capacity (e.g. hook::preandpost and hook::wrapsub), hook::lexwrap
implements wrappers in such a way that the standard caller function
works correctly within the wrapped subroutine.
