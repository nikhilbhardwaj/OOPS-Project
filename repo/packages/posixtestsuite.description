Posix conformance test suite (dummy package)
	
the posix test suite is a free (as in speech) test suite with the goal of
performing conformance, functional, and stress testing of the ieee
1003.1-2001 system interfaces specification in a manner that is agnostic to
any given implementation.

this is a dummy package.  if you want to run the testsuite, use the source
package of the same name (e.g. apt-get source posixtestsuite).
