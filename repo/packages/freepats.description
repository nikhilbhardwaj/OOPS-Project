Free patch set for midi audio synthesis
	
freepats is a free patch set suitable for midi audio synthesis.  it is not
complete, nor comprehensive yet, and most, if not all patches are in the
old and limited gus patch format.

it is, however, the sole dfsg-compliant patch set in existence so far.
new patches (including those in better formats, such as sf2 soundfont banks)
are welcome.
