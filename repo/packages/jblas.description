A fast linear algebra library for java
	
jblas is a fast linear algebra library for java. jblas is essentially
a light-weight wrapper around blas and lapack routines, the
de-facto industry standard for matrix computations. it uses
state-of-the-art implementations like atlas for all its computational
routines, making it very fast.

this package contains the binaries and examples.
