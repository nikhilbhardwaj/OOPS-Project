Opendx (ibm visualization data explorer) - development files
	
data explorer is a system of tools and user interfaces for visualizing data.
in general terms the visualization of data can be considered a 3-stage
process:

   1. describing and importing data
   2. processing the data through a visualization program
   3. presenting the resulting image.

this is the development package. it contains the build rules, library
routines and header files necessary for creating custom software that uses
the opendx classes.
