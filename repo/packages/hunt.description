Advanced packet sniffer and connection intrusion
	
hunt is a program for intruding into a connection, watching it and
resetting it.

note that as hunt is operating on ethernet, it is best used for connections
which can be watched through it. however, it is possible to do something
even for hosts on another segments or hosts that are on switched ports.
