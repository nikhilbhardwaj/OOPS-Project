C(++) beautifier
	
bcpp indents c/c++ source programs, replacing tabs with spaces or the
reverse. unlike indent, it does (by design) not attempt to wrap long
statements.

this version improves the parsing algorithm by marking the state of all
characters, recognizes a wider range of indention structures, and implements
a simple algorithm for indenting embedded sql.
