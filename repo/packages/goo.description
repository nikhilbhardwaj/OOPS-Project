Generic object-orientator (programming language)
	
goo is a dynamic, type-based, object-oriented language in the same family
as dylan and scheme.  it is designed to be simple, productive, powerful,
extensible, dynamic, efficient, and real-time.

its main goal is to offer the best of both scripting and delivery
languages, while at the same time incorporating an extreme back-to-basics
philosophy.
