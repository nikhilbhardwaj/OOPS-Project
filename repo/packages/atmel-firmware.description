Firmware for atmel at76c50x wireless networking chips.
	
the drivers for these chips in the linux 2.6.x kernel do not include
the firmware; this firmware needs to be loaded by the host on most
cards using these chips. this package provides the firmware images
which should be automatically loaded as needed by the hotplug
system. it also provides a small loader utility which can be used to
accomplish the same thing when hotplug is not in use.
