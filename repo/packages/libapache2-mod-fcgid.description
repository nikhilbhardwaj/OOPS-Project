An alternative module compat with mod_fastcgi
	
mod_fcgid is a high performance alternative to mod_cgi or mod_cgid,
which starts a sufficient number instances of the cgi program to handle
concurrent requests, and these programs remain running to handle further
incoming requests. it is favored by the php developers, for example,
as a preferred alternative to running mod_php in-process, delivering
very similar performance.

it is a binary compatibility alternative to apache module mod_fastcgi.
