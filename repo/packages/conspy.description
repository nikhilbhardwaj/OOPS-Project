Remote control of linux virtual consoles
	
conspy allows a (possibly remote) user to see what is displayed
on a linux virtual console, and send keystrokes to it.  it is
rather like vnc, but where vnc takes control of a gui conspy
takes control of a text mode virtual console.  unlike vnc,
conspy does not require a server to be installed prior to being
used.
