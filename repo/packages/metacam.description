Extract exif information from digital camera files
	
exif stands for exchangeable image file format, and is a standard for
storing interchange information in image files, especially those using
jpeg compression. most digital cameras now use the exif format. the
format is part of the dcf standard created by jeida to encourage
interoperability between imaging devices. in addition to the standard
exif fields, metacam also supports vendor-specific extensions from
nikon, olympus, canon and casio.
