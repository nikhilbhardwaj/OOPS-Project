Defines rgb values for common color names
	
this package defines rgb values for common color names. the intention
is to:

  1. provide a common module that authors can use with other modules
     to specify colors; and
  2. free module authors from having to "re-invent the wheel"
     whenever they decide to give the users the option of specifying
     a color by name rather than rgb value.
