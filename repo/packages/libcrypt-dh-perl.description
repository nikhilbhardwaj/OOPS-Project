Diffie-hellman key exchange system implemented in perl
	
diffie-hellman is an algorithm by which two parties can agree on a
shared secret key, known only to them. the secret is negotiated over an
insecure network without the two parties ever passing the actual shared
secret, or their private keys, between them.
