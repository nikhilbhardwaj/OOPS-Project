Binfmt_misc plugin for utf-8 scripts
	
this package provides an additional binary format for linux: scripts
which start with an utf-8 signature (aka bom), i.e.  with the byte
sequence \xef\xbb\xbf#!.

this is particularly useful for scripting languages which recognize
the bom, e.g. python. with python 2.3 or newer, scripts with the utf-8
bom are considered utf-8 enocded without the need for an addition
encoding declaration.
