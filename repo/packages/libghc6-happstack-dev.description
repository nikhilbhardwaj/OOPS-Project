Haskell web framework - ghc 6 libraries
	
happstack is a haskell web framework, designed so that developers can
prototype quickly, deploy painlessly, scale massively, operate reliably,
and change easily. it supports gnu/linux, os x, freebsd, and windows
environments.

happstack provides you with all the components you need to build and
deploy your application, which is completely self-contained.
particularly, happstack provides the application with a distributed and
persistent data storage layer, capable to interact with the application
itself directly in terms of haskell data structures.

this package contains the libraries compiled for ghc 6.
