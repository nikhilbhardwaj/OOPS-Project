Creates wav files from audio cds
	
icedax lets you digitally copy ("rip") audio tracks from a cd, avoiding
the distortion that is introduced when recording via a sound card. data
can be dumped into raw (cdr), wav or sun format sound files. options control
the recording format (stereo/mono; 8/16 bits; sampling rate, etc).

please install cdrkit-doc if you want most of the documentation and
readme files.
