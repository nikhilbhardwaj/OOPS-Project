Libraries to checkpoint and restart linux processes
	
blcr (berkeley lab checkpoint/restart) allows programs running on
linux to be "checkpointed" (written entirely to a file), and then
later "restarted".

blcr can checkpoint both single- and multithreaded (pthreads)
programs linked with the nptl implementation of pthreads. blcr is
also able to save and restore groups of related processes together
with the pipes that connect them.

this package contains the debug symbols for the libcr library.
