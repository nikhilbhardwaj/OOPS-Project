Network card modules for sparc kernels
	
this package contains the drivers for the happy meal/big mac 10/100baset,
sun quadethernet and myricom gigabit ethernet sbus devices for sparc
systems, as well as various pci nic drivers (only on sparc64.)

do not install this package on a real debian system! you probably
want a kernel-image package instead.
