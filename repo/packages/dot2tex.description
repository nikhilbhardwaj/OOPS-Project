Graphviz to latex converter
	
the purpose of dot2tex is to give graphs generated by the graph layout tool
graphviz a more latex friendly look and feel. this is accomplished by:


 - using native pstricks and pgf/tikz commands for drawing arrows,
   edges and nodes.
 - typesetting labels with latex, allowing mathematical notation.
 - using backend specific styles to customize the output.
