A computational logic for applicative common lisp: library certificates
	
acl2 is both a programming language in which you can model computer
systems and a tool to help you prove properties of those models.

this file contains certification records for the various precompiled
libraries supplied in the acl2-books package.  acl2 essentially
requires that all included books be certified before use.
