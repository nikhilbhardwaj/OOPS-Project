Xmpp perl library
	
net::xmpp is a convenient tool to use for any perl script that would like to
utilize the xmpp instant messaging protocol.  while not a client in and of
itself, it provides all of the necessary back-end functions to make a cgi
client or command-line perl client feasible and easy to use.
