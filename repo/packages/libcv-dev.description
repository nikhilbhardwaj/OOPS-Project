Development files for libcv
	
this package contains the header files and static library needed to compile
applications that use opencv (open computer vision).

the open computer vision library is a collection of algorithms and sample
code for various computer vision problems. the library is compatible with
ipl (intel's image processing library) and, if available, can use ipp
(intel's integrated performance primitives) for better performance.

opencv provides low level portable data types and operators, and a set
of high level functionalities for video acquisition, image processing and
analysis, structural analysis, motion analysis and object tracking, object
recognition, camera calibration and 3d reconstruction.
