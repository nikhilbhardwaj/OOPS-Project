Use perl code in ocaml programs, documentation
	
perl4caml allows you to use perl code within objective caml (ocaml),
thus neatly side-stepping the old problem with ocaml which was that it
lacked a comprehensive set of libraries. well now you can use any part
of cpan in your ocaml code.

this package provides developers' documentation and examples about the
use of perl4caml.
