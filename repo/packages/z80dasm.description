Disassembler for the zilog z80 microprocessor
	
the z80 microprocessor is used in some 1980s home microcomputers, such as the
sinclair zx80, zx81, spectrum, galaksija and in several newer devices, such
as graphical calculators from texas instruments and the original gameboy.

this disassembler is useful for reverse engineering programs and operating
systems written for such devices. it produces assembly source code from binary
rom images and tries to guess locations of labels and symbols. its output can
be directly converted back to binary with a z80 assembler, such as z80asm.
