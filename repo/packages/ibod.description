Isdn mppp bandwidth on demand daemon
	
ibod is a isdn mppp bandwidth on demand daemon designed to operate in
conjunction with isdn4linux. the program monitors inbound and outbound
traffic on the isdn interface. when the required bandwidth exceeds the
capacity for the current number of isdn b-channels, more (slave)
channels are connected according to the mppp protocol. when the traffic
decreases, the slave channel(s) are disconnected.
