State of the art machine learning library - development files
	
torch is a machine-learning library, written in c++.  its aim is to
provide the state-of-the-art of the best algorithms.


 * many gradient-based methods, including multi-layered perceptrons,
   radial basis functions, and mixtures of experts.  many small "modules"
   (linear module, tanh module, softmax module, ...) can be plugged
   together.
 * support vector machine, for classification and regression.
 * distribution package, includes kmeans, gaussian mixture models,
   hidden markov models, and bayes classifier, and classes for speech
   recognition with embedded training.
 * ensemble models such as bagging and adaboost.
 * non-parametric models such as k-nearest-neighbors, parzen regression
   and parzen density estimator.


this package is the torch development package (header files and
static library.)
