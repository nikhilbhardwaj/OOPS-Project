German development manpages
	
this package contains the linux manual pages translated into german.
the following sections are provided:

 * 2 = linux system calls.
 * 3 = libc calls (note that a more comprehensive source of
       information may be found in one of the libc-doc packages).


the english package manpages-dev is likely to contain additional and more
up-to-date versions than the german translation.
