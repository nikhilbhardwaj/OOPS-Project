Perl::tidy plugin for padre
	
the perltidy plugin is a simple plugin to run perl::tidy on your
source code. currently there are no customisable options (since the
padre plugin system doesnâ€™t support that yet) - however perl::tidy
will use your normal .perltidyrc file if it exists (see perl::tidy
documentation).
