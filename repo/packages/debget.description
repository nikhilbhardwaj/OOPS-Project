Download/compile source and binary debian packages
	
debget downloads source and binary debian packages by name.  it doesn't
require a local copy of the packages files, instead it queries
packages.debian.org to find out what versions are available.

debget can also optionally unpack and compile source packages, and even
install the generated binary packages.  if you intend to use these
features you should install the devscripts package for the dscverify
script it contains.
