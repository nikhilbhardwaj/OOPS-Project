Run apache in a secure chroot environment
	
mod_chroot allows you to run apache in a chroot jail with no additional files.
you don't need to create a special directory hierarchy containing, for example,
/dev or /lib. setting up the chroot happens by adjusting the `chrootdir'
directive within your `httpd.conf'.

this package includes the mod_chroot module for apache version 2.x
