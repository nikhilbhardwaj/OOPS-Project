Module to handle general file input/output operations
	
mixin::linewise is a perl module that provides a generalized framework for
handling input/output operations. it can open files for i/o, convert strings
to handle type objects, and more.

with reader and writer classes, you can just write a method to manipulate
normal handles, and let the modules do the rest, like providing string and
filename handling methods.
