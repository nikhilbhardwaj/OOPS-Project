Module to find and use installed perl modules
	
module::find is a perl module that allows developers to find and use modules
in categories. this is useful for auto-detecting driver or plugin modules.
you can differentiate between looking in the category itself or in all
subcategories.

if you want module::find to search in a certain directory (like the plugins
directory of your software installation), make sure you modify @inc before
you call the module::find functions.
