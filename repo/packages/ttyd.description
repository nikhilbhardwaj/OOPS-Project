Remote modem utility for unix
	
the ttyd daemon is fully telnet compatible allowing
programs to connect to any remote device such as
networked modems and terminal servers as if they were
local devices as long as the device utilizes the telnet
protocol, eg. another host running termnetd or a
console access server.
