Structured file library - development files for gnome
	
this package contains the development files used in building applications
that use the gnome structured file library.

the gnome structured file library aims to provide an efficient
extensible i/o abstraction for dealing with different structured file
formats. it is actively being developed and its api is still likely to
undergo significant changes (in particular, extensions).

this package supports the use of bonobo, gnome's corba-based component
architecture and of gnome-vfs, the gnome virtual file-system.
