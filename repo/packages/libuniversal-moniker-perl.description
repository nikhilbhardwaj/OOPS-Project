Nicer names for your perl modules/classes
	
class names in perl often don't sound great when spoken, or look good
when written in prose. for this reason, we tend to say things like
"customer" or "basket" when we are referring to
"my::site::user::customer" or "my::site::shop::basket". we thought it
would be nice if our classes knew what we would prefer to call them.

this module will add a "moniker" (and "plural_moniker") method to
"universal", and so to every class or module.
