Common internet file system utilities - compatibility package
	
the smb/cifs protocol provides support for cross-platform file sharing with
microsoft windows, os x, and other unix systems.

this package provides wrapper utilities for compatibility with the old
"smbfs" filesystem type: smbmount, smbumount, and mount.smbfs.
