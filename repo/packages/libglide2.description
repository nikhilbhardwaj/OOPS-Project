Graphics library for 3dfx voodoo based cards - shared libraries
	
this package allows you to use the 3d functions of cards based on
3dfx interactive, inc's voodoo 2 chipsets. you should install it if
you use such a card.

this package is not useful with voodoo banshee, voodoo 3,
voodoo 4, or voodoo 5 cards, and the original voodoo graphics chipset
is no longer supported.

you'll need the 3dfx kernel driver to use this library.
