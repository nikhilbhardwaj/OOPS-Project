Nintendo entertainment system emulator
	
nestra is a dynamic recompiler which translates 6502 code into native code
to emulate a nintendo entertainment system. execution of the translated
code is quite fast, and the emulator can run at full speed with relatively
modest cpu requirements. however, there is no sound support.

to use this program, you need nes roms which are not included.
