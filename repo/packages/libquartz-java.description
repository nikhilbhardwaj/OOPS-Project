Open source job scheduling system
	
quartz is a full-featured, open source job scheduling system that can
be integrated with, or used along side virtually any j2ee or j2se
application - from the smallest stand-alone application to the
largest e-commerce system. quartz can be used to create simple or
complex schedules for executing tens, hundreds, or even
tens-of-thousands of jobs; jobs whose tasks are defined as standard
java components or ejbs. the quartz scheduler includes many
enterprise-class features, such as jta transactions and clustering.
