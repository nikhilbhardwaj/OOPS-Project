Perl module to convert numbers to spanish text
	
lingua::es::numeros is an arbitrary precision number converter to its textual
representation in spanish. supports cardinals, ordinals and reals. as managed
numbers are widely longer than perl's native number management, these are
handled as character strings, allowing unlimited growth on the conversion
system.
