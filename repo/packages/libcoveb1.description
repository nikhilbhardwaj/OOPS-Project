Range finding priority queue using optimized data structure
	
cache oblivious data structures have gained enormous popularity in
theoretical computer science over recent decades.  this package uses
the van emde boas cache oblivious priority queue to provide high throughput
unsigned integer priority queue and range finding operations ideally
suited anywhere 32-bit discrete keys are utilized.
