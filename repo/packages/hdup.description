hdup is a backup utility with the following characteristics:

remote backups (move the backup to another machine); encrypted backups;
no obscure format for the backups; compression (gzip/bzip or none);
simple to use.

the source also includes two manpages, one for hdup itself and the other
for the configuration file. it should be fairly obvious how to use hdup.
