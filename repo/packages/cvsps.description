Tool to generate cvs patch set information
	
cvsps is a program for generating 'patch set' information from a cvs
repository.  a patch set in this case is defined as a set of changes made
to a collection of files, all committed at the same time (using a single
'cvs commit' command).  this information is valuable for seeing the
big picture of the evolution of a cvs project.  while cvs tracks revision
information, it is often difficult to see what changes were committed
'atomically' to the repository.
