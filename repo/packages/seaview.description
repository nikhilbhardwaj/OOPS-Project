Multiplatform interface for sequence alignment and phylogeny
	
seaview reads and writes various file formats (nexus, msf, clustal, fasta,
phylip, mase, newick) of dna and protein sequences and of phylogenetic trees.
alignments can be manually edited. it drives the programs muscle or clustalÂ w
for multiple sequence alignment, and also allows to use any external alignment
algorithm able to read and write fasta-formatted files. it computes
phylogenetic trees by parsimony using phylip's dnapars/protpars algorithm, by
distance with nj or bionj algorithms on a variety of evolutionary distances, or
by maximum likelihood using the program phyml 3.0. seaview draws phylogenetic
trees on screen or postscript files, and allows to download sequences from
embl/genbank/uniprot using the internet.
