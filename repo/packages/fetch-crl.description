Downloads certificate revocation lists
	
this tool and associated cron entry ensure that certificate revocation
lists (crls) are periodically retrieved from the web sites of the
respective certification authorities.

the fetch-crl tool finds all *.crl_url files in the configured crl
directory, downloads the crls listed in those files and saves them in
the same directory. the default configuration uses
/etc/grid-security/certificates as the crl directory.
