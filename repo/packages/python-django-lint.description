Static analysis tool for django projects and applications
	
django lint is a tool that statically analyses projects and applications
that use the django web development framework.

it checks and reports on common programming errors and bad code smells
including:


 * nullable "charfield" fields
 * usage of brittle django features such as "auto_now_add"
 * unspecified recommended options in settings.py, such as an empty 'admins'
 * (plus many more)
