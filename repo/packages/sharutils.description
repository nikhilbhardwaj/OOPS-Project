Shar, unshar, uuencode, uudecode
	
`shar' makes so-called shell archives out of many files, preparing
them for transmission by electronic mail services.  `unshar' helps
unpacking shell archives after reception.  other related utility
programs help with other tasks.

`uuencode' prepares a file for transmission over an electronic
channel which ignores or otherwise mangles the eight bit (high
order bit) of bytes.  `uudecode' does the converse transformation.
