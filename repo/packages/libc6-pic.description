Embedded gnu c library: pic archive library
	
contains an archive library (ar file) composed of individual shared objects.
this is used for creating a library which is a smaller subset of the
standard libc shared library. the reduced library is used on the debian
boot floppies. if you are not making your own set of debian boot floppies
using the `boot-floppies' package, you probably don't need this package.
