Approximate nearest neighbor searching library (development files)
	
ann is a library written in c++, which supports data structures and
algorithms for both exact and approximate nearest neighbor searching
in arbitrarily high dimensions.  ann assumes that distances
are measured using any class of distance functions called minkowski
metrics. these include the well known euclidean distance, manhattan
distance, and max distance. ann performs quite efficiently for point
sets ranging in size from thousands to hundreds of thousands, and in
dimensions as high as 20.

this package contains the header files for developing applications
with the ann library.
