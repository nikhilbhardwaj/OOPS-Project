Bootloader for mips based sgi ip22 and ip32 machines
	
arcboot is a bootloader for sgi ip22 and ip32 machines like the indy, indigo2
and o2. it is able to boot the linux kernel from ext2 and ext3 filesystems.
support for other arcs based subarchitectures can easily be added. it is
currently not capable of booting irix or to boot from iso9660 cdroms though.
