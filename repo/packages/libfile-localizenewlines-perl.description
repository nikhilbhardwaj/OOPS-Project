Perl module to localize the newlines for one or more files
	
file::localizenewlines is a module that allows users to easily fix conflicting
newline formats (particularly unix- and win32-style line endings). it changes
every end-of-line character to those of the local platform, and even corrects
instances where multiple different newline formats are used in the same file.
