Desktop application for managing virtual machines
	
it presents a summary view of running domains and their live performance &
resource utilization statistics. a detailed view presents graphs showing
performance & utilization over time. ultimately it will allow creation of new
domains, and configuration & adjustment of a domain's resource allocation &
virtual hardware.  finally an embedded vnc client viewer presents a full
graphical console to the guest domain.

note: the gui is still considered experimental.
