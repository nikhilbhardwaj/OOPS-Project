Shared libraries for the afterstep window manager
	
afterstep is a window manager based on fvwm which attempts to emulate
the nextstep look and feel, while retaining the configurability of its
predecessor.  note that this window manager makes extensive use of the
color palette.  if you have only an 8-bit color display, it will run
as packaged, but you may want to modify the configuration to use fewer
colors.

this package contains runtime libraries needed by afterstep.
