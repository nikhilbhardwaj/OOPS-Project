The squeak smalltalk system (virtual machine)
	
squeak is a full-featured implementation of the smalltalk programming
language and environment based on (and largely compatible with) the
original smalltalk-80 system.

this package contains just the squeak virtual machine.  if you are
new to squeak then you will have to install a squeak image too before
you can run squeak. squeak images can be downloaded from
http://www.squeak.org, http://www.squeakland.org or
