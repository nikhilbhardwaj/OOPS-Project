Generic c++ template library for sparse, dense and skyline matrices
	
gmm++ is a framework of pre-defined methods for matrix computation. it is built
as a set of generic algorithms for any interfaced vector type or matrix type.

it can be viewed as a glue library allowing cooperation between several vector
and matrix types. however, basic sparse, dense and skyline matrix/vector types
are built-in, hence it can be used as a standalone linear algebra library.
