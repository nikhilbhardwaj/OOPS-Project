Web interface to a poker-network server
	
play poker with other players connected on a poker-network server
(holdem, omaha, omaha high/low, stud 7 ...) in ring games, sit and go
or multitables tournaments. poker2d will automatically reconnect to
the table if the connection is lost and allows playing on multiple
tables simultaneously.
