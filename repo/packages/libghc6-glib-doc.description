Binding to the glib library for gtk2hs; documentation
	
this package provides the documentation for a library for the haskell
programming language.
see http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on haskell.

the gnu library is a collection of c data structures and utility function for
dealing with unicode. this package only binds as much functionality as
required to support the packages that wrap libraries that are themselves based
on glib.
