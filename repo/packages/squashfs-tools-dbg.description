Tool to create and append to squashfs filesystems (debug)
	
squashfs is a highly compressed read-only filesystem for linux. it uses zlib
compression to compress both files, inodes and directories. inodes in the
system are very small and all blocks are packed to minimise data overhead.
block sizes greater than 4k are supported up to a maximum of 64k.

this package contains the debugging symbols.
