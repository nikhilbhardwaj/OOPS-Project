Library for assembly code compilation at runtime
	
gnu lightning is a library to aid in making portable programs that compile
assembly code at run time.  it produces very fast code, making it ideal for
just-in-time compilers, and it abstracts over the target cpu, as it exposes to
the clients a standardized risc instruction set inspired by the mips and sparc
chips.

lightning currently supports the i386, powerpc and sparc architectures.
