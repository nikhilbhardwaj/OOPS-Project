sciscipy provides a python api to map scilab features.
three main methods are available:

 * sciscipy.eval(sci_cmd)
 * sciscipy.read(sci_var_name)
 * sciscipy.write(sci_var_name, py_var_name)


also, to increase the level of enjoyment, a python module
called scilab is also provided. this package contains a
class 'scilab' that can be used to issue any valid scilab
function.
