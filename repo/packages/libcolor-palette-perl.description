Module to manipulate sets of named colours
	
color::palette is a framework of perl modules designed to construct and
manipulate sets of named colours. this makes it easy to write applications
that can define and validate the color names as required. colours can be
specified using a graphics::color object, a css-style hex triple (#rrggbb),
an arrayref of rgb values, or as the name of another colour that appears in
the palette.
