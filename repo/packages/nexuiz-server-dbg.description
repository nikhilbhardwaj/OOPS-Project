Debug symols for the nexuiz game server
	
nexuiz is a fast-paced 3d deathmatch game with high-end and complex graphics
effects. it is intended to be played over the internet or over a local network.
though it also supports a single-player mode.

the game brings deathmatch back to the basics, with perfect weapon  balancing
and fast paced action, keeping itself away from the current trend of realistic
shooters.

this package installs the debug symbols for the standalone server.
