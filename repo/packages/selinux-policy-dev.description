Headers from the selinux reference policy for building modules
	
the selinux reference policy (refpolicy) is a complete selinux
policy, as an alternative to the existing strict and targeted
policies available from http://selinux.sf.net. the goal is to have
this policy as the system policy, be and used as the basis for
creating other policies. refpolicy is based on the current strict and
targeted policies, but aims to accomplish many additional
goals:

 + strong modularity
 + clearly stated security goals
 + documentation
 + development tool support
 + forward looking
 + configurability
 + flexible base policy
 + application policy variations
 + multi-level security


this package provides header files for building your own selinux
policy packages compatible with official policy packages.
