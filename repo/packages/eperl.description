Embedded perl 5 language
	
eperl interprets an ascii file bristled with perl 5 program statements by
evaluating the perl 5 code while passing through the plain ascii data. it
can operate in various ways: as a stand-alone unix filter or integrated
perl 5 module for general file generation tasks and as a powerful webserver
scripting language for dynamic html page programming.
