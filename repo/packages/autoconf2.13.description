Automatic configure script builder (obsolete version)
	
obsolete compatibility package of autoconf 2.13.  for use only with
packages that cannot easily be updated to use autoconf 2.50+.

this package provides compatibility wrappers for autoconf,
autoheader, and autoreconf that attempt to automatically choose which
version of autoconf to use, based on some simple heuristics.  for
information on these heuristics or how to force use of a particular
autoconf version, see /usr/share/doc/autoconf2.13/readme.debian.gz.
