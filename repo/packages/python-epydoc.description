Tool for documenting python modules
	
epydoc is a tool for generating api documentation for python modules based on
their docstrings.  a lightweight markup language called epytext can be used to
format docstrings and to add information about specific fields, such as
parameters and instance variables.  epydoc also understands docstrings written
in restructuredtext, javadoc, and plaintext.

this package contains the epydoc and epydocgui commands, their manpages, and
their associated python modules.
