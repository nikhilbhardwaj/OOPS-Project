Perl module to critique code for best practices
	
perl::critic is an extensible framework for creating and applying software
coding policies to perl source code. by default, it is distributed with a
number of policy modules that attempt to enforce various coding guidelines,
including those discussed in damian conway's perl best practices. however,
it is not limited to pbp and will even support policies that contradict pbp.
you can enable, disable and customize those policies through the perl::critic
interface. you can also create new policy modules to suit your own tastes.
