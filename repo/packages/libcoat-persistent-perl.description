Simple orm inspired by ruby's activerecord
	
coat::persistent is an object relational mapper (orm) for databases, which
allows you to build instances of coat objects and save them into a database
transparently. it allows one to execute sql commands directly as well.

the underlying target of this module is to port the whole activerecord::base
api to perl. it is still a development version and should not be used in a
production environment.
