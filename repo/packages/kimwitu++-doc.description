Documentation for the (syntax-)tree-handling tool kimwitu++
	
kimwitu++ is a system that supports the construction of programs that use
trees or terms as their main data structure.  it allows you to define, store
and operate on trees with typed nodes. each type of node has a specific number
of sons, and expects these sons to have specific types.  the most popular
example of such trees are syntax trees.

this is the documentation for kimwitu++ in pdf and html format.
