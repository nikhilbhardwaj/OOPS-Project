Graphical graph editor based on hyperbolic geometry
	
ocamlgraph editor is an interactive graph editor for gnome; it is based
on hyperbolic geometry (it "zooms" more on graph nodes which are in the
center of the editing area and zooms less on periferic nodes).

ocamlgraph editor works with the following file formats to load and
save graphs: gml (graph modelling language), dot (the file format used
by graphviz).

ocamlgraph is still to be considered experimental.
