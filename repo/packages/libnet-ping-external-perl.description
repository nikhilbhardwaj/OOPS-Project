Provide an interface to the system ping command
	
net::ping::external is a module which interfaces with the "ping"
command on many systems. it presently provides a single function,
ping(), that takes in a hostname and (optionally) a timeout and
returns true if the host is alive, and false otherwise. unless
you have the ability (and willingness) to run your scripts as
the superuser on your system, this module will probably provide
more accurate results than net::ping will.
