Strongswan plugin to interact with networkmanager
	
strongswan is an ipsec-based vpn solution for the linux kernel. it uses the
native ipsec stack and runs on any recent 2.6 kernel (no patching required).
it supports both ikev1 and the newer ikev2 protocols.

this plugin provides an interface which allows networkmanager to configure
and control the ikev2 daemon directly through d-bus. it is designed to work
in conjunction with the network-manager-strongswan package, providing
a simple graphical frontend to configure ipsec based vpns.
