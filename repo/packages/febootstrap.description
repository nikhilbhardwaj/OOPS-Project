Tool for bootstrapping a fedora system (like debian debootstrap)
	
febootstrap is a tool for creating a fedora boot filesystem. you can
think of it as the fedora equivalent of debootstrap. like debootstrap,
febootstrap doesn't need to be run as root.

febootstrap comes with tools to create initrd.img (initramfs) images
directly. there are also tools to minimize the size of the generated
system by removing unnecessary files.
