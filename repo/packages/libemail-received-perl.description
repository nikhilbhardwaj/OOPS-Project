Perl module to parse an email received: header
	
email::received is a perl email project rewrite of spamassassin's email
header parser. this was done so that the great work they did in analysing
pretty much every possible received header format could be used in
applications other than spamassassin itself.

the module provides one function, parse_received, which takes a single
received line. it then produces either nothing, if the line is unparsable,
or a hash reference if it parsed the message.
