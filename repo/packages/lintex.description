Automatic cleanup of old tex-related files
	
removes unneeded files after a (la)tex run: .aux, .log, .dvi, etc, if their
timestamp is more recent than the tex file's. also removes the backup files
created by your text editor. this keeps a directory containing multiple (la)tex
documents from becoming unmanageable.
