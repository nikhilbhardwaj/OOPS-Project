Perl module providing lexically scoped environment (%env)
	
env::sanctify is a module that provides lexically scoped manipulation and
sanctification of %env. with this module, one can add or alter environment
variables, later restoring the environment back either manually or
automatically once the object falls out of scope.

this is useful for manipulating the environment that forked processes and
sub-processes will inherit.
