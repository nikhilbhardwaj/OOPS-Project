Make urls clickable in html
	
template::plugin::clickable is a plugin for the perl template toolkit
which allows you to  filter html to make any embedded urls clickable.
the basic idea is  that it searches the text for any http:// and https://
urls that are  not marked up and adds the correct html anchor tags to make
them into hyperlinks.
