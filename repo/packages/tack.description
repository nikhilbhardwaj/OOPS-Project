Terminfo action checker
	
the 'tack' program is a diagnostic tool that is designed to create and verify
the correctness of terminfo's. this program can be used to create new terminal
descriptions that are not included in the standard ncurses release.

although 'tack' has been distributed with ncurses-bin, it is not an integral
part of ncurses and was thus split out from it by upstream.
