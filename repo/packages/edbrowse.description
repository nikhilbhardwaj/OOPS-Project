A /bin/ed-alike webbrowser written in c
	
edbrowse is a reimplementation of /bin/ed, with some basic
differences (it uses perl regular expressions) with the ability to
visit webpages and ftp sites. edbrowse performs basic transformations
on the html source to produce a readable representation. edbrowse
supports forms, frames, netscape-style cookies, https
connections and javascript.
