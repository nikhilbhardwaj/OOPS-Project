Boost.python library development files (default version)
	
this package forms part of the boost c++ libraries collection.

the boost python library is used to quickly and easily export a c++
library to python such that the python interface is very similar to
the c++ interface. it is designed to be minimally intrusive on your
c++ design. in most cases, you should not have to alter your c++
classes in any way in order to use them with boost.python.  the
system should simply "reflect" your c++ classes and functions into
python. the major features of boost.python include support for:
subclassing extension types in python, overriding virtual functions
in python, member function overloading, automatic wrapping of
numeric operators among others.

this package also contains the pyste boost.python code generator that
allows the user to specify classes and functions to be exported using
a simple interface file, which following the boost.python's
philosophy, is simple python code.

this package allows development of a python interface for all current
versions of python in debian.  code using this library will need also
one of the python development packages.

this package is a dependency package, which depends on debian's default
boost version (currently 1.42).
