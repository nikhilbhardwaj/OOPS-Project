Import upstream archives into tla/arch
	
tom lord's arch/tla system is capable of importing upstream directories
into a tla archive for some archives.  for situations where the upstream
renames or moves files and directories on a regular basis, version
information can be lost.

tla-load-dirs works with tla to import these things and preserve
changes.  it works on a principle similar to subversion's
svn_load_dirs.
