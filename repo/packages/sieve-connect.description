A client for the managesieve protocol
	
this is sieve-connect.  a client for the managesieve protocol, as
implemented by timsieved in cyrus imap.

sieve-connect is designed to be both a tool which can be invoked from
scripts and also a decent interactive client.  it should also be a
drop-in replacement for "sieveshell", as supplied with cyrus imap.
