Debug memory allocation library
	
drop in replacement for the system's `malloc', `realloc', `calloc', `free' and
other memory management routines while providing powerful debugging facilities
configurable at runtime.

these facilities include such things as memory-leak tracking, fence-post write
detection, file/line number reporting, and general logging of statistics.

this package contains only the shared libraries, the development files and
documentation is in the libdmalloc-dev package.
