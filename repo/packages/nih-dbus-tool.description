Nih d-bus binding tool
	
nih-dbus-tool generates c source code from the d-bus introspection xml
data provided by most services; either to make implementing the
described objects in c programs or to make proxying to the described
remote objects easier.

the generated code requires libnih-dbus-dev to be compiled.
