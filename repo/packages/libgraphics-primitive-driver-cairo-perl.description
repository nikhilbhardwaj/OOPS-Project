Backend providing graphics support using cairo
	
graphics::primitive::driver::cairo is a backend implementation using cairo
that draws graphics::primitive objects (see libgraphics-primitive-perl). in
most cases, this module will not be used directly, but rather as part of your
application using graphics::primitive.
