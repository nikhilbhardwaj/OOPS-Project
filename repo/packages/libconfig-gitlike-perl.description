Perl module for git-compatible config file parsing
	
config::gitlike provides a perl interface for parsing, writing, and managing
configuration files of the format used by the version control system git. it
supports config-file inheritance in the same way that git does: system-wide,
user-wide, and per-directory config files can be specified and loaded, with
values from more local files overriding those in less-local files.

for more information on this configuration file format, see:
