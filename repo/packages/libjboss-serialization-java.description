Jboss serialization
	
jbossserialization is a new approach to java-serialization. the main
feature in jbossserialization besides performance, is smart cloning.

smart cloning is the capability of the reuse of final fields among
different class loaders doing exactly what serialization does,
without the need of convert every field into a bytearray. this
approach is at least 10 times faster than using serialization over a
byte array.
