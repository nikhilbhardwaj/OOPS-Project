Module to generate html and javascript for the prototype library
	
html::prototype contains some code generators for prototype, the famous
javascript oo library and the script.aculous extensions.

the prototype library (http://prototype.conio.net/) is designed to make
ajax easy. catalyst::plugin::prototype makes it easy to connect to the
prototype library.

this is mostly a port of the ruby on rails helper tags for javascript
for use in catalyst.
