Simple mixer control program with gui and text interfaces
	
aumix is a small, easy-to-use program to control the mixer of your sound
card. it runs in text mode using the ncurses library, or from the command
line (non-interactively). it can read default settings from a file, and it
can also automatically save and restore the mixer settings at shutdown and
boot.

additionally this version can be run as a gtk+ app, i.e. with a graphical
interface.  it can also still run in text-only mode, though.
