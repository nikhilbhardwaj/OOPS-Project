Really small http/https proxy
	
micro_proxy is a very small unix-based http/https proxy. it runs from inetd,
which means its performance is poor. but for low-traffic sites, it's quite
adequate. it implements all the basic features of an http/https proxy,
including ipv6 forwarding, in only 320 lines of code.
