Perl module for generating common types of methods
	
the class::makemethods framework allows perl class developers to
quickly define common types of methods. when a module uses
class::makemethods or one of its subclasses, it can select from a
variety of supported method types, and specify a name for each method
desired. the methods are dynamically generated and installed in the
calling package.
