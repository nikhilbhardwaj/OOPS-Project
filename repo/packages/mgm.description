A highly configurable, very gaudy system load meter
	
mgm is the moaning goat meter, a system load monitor along the lines
of procmeter3 but much prettier (and with a much higher resource usage).
it's written in perl/tk, uses a nice antialiased helvetica font, is
configurable with x resources, and can have a larger memory footprint than
emacs.
