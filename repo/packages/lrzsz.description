Tools for zmodem/xmodem/ymodem file transfer
	
lrzsz is a cosmetically modified zmodem/ymodem/xmodem package built
from the public-domain version of chuck forsberg's rzsz package.

these programs use error correcting protocols ({z,x,y}modem) to send
(sz, sx, sb) and receive (rz, rx, rb) files over a dial-in serial port
from a variety of programs running under various operating systems.
