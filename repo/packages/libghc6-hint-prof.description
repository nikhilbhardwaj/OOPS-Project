Runtime haskell interpreter (ghc api wrapper); profiling libraries
	
this package provides a library for the haskell programming language,
compiled for profiling.
see http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on haskell.

this library defines an interpreter monad. it allows to load haskell modules,
browse them, type-check and evaluate strings with haskell expressions and even
coerce them into values. the library is thread-safe and type-safe (even the
coercion of expressions to values). it is, esentially, a huge subset of the
ghc api wrapped in a simpler api. works with ghc 6.10.x and 6.8.x (this
version was not tested with ghc 6.6).
