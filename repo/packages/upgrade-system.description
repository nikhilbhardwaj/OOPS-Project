System upgrader from konflux
	
upgrade-system offers a convenient way to keep a debian system up-to-date,
yet free from accumulated cruft such as obsolete libraries.

it is particularly useful on systems that mix packages from different
releases (stable/testing/unstable) and on desktop systems where packages
are frequently installed or removed according to evolving user tastes.
