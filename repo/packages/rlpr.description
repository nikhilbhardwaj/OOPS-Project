A utility for lpd printing without using /etc/printcap
	
rlpr makes it possible (or at the very least, easier), to print files
on remote sites to your local printer, and vice versa.  the rlpr
package includes bsd-compatible replacements for 'lpr', 'lpq', and
'lprm', whose functionality is a superset of their bsd counterparts.  in other
words, with the rlpr package, you can do everything you can do with the bsd
printing commands, and more.  the programs contained within the rlpr
package are all gpl'd, and are more lightweight, cleaner and more
secure than their bsd counterparts.
