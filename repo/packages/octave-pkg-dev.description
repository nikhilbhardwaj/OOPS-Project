Infrastructure to build octave packages
	
since version 3.0 of octave (a numerical computation software),
add-ons can be installed through the pkg.m system.  this package
provides the infrastructure for packaging such add-ons for debian.
it contains a makefile scrap for inclusion in debian/rules, as well
as the necessary code for generating the appropriate maintainer
scripts as well as the replacing the substitution variables in
debian/control.

this package is intended to be used by the debian octave group
and should be of little interest to general users.
