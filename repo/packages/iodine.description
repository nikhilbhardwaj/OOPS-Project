Tool for tunneling ipv4 data through a dns server
	
this is a piece of software that lets you tunnel ipv4 data through a dns
server. this can be usable in different situations where internet access is
firewalled, but dns queries are allowed.

iodine is similar to nstx but has password authentication, brings up the
tun interface automatically and lets the user specify the ip address as a
command line option.
