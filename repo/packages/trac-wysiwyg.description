Wysiwyg style editor for the trac issue tracking system
	
trac-wysiwyg allows the user to edit all textarea fields in trac in a
wysiwyg style, e.g. in wiki pages, ticket descriptions, ticket
comments and so on. users may freely switch between the traditional
and wysiwyg editing mode during editing. especially the aid in
editing tables justifies the installation of this plugin.
