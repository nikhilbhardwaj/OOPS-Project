Binary decision-diagram library (development)
	
binary decision diagrams (bdds) are space-efficient encodings of
boolean expressions or dynamic truth tables, used in eg. model
checking.  buddy is an efficient bdd library with all the standard
bdd operations, dynamic reordering of variables, automated garbage
collection, a c++ interface with automatic reference counting, and
more.

libbdd-dev is the buddy development package containing a static
library and the include files needed for building applications using
buddy.
