Java game controller api
	
jinput is an implementation of an api for game controller discovery and
polled input. it is part of a suite of open-source technologies initiated by
the game technology group at sun microsystems with intention of making the
development of high performance games in java a reality.
the api itself is pure java and presents a platform-neutral completely
portable model of controller discovery and polling. it can handle arbitrary
controllers and returns both human and machine understandable descriptions
of the inputs available.
