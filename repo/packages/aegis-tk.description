Aegis tk user interface
	
aegis provides a framework within which a team of developers may
work on many changes to a program independently, and aegis
coordinates integrating these changes back into the master source
of the program, with as little disruption as possible.

aegis simplifies the problems associated with multiple developers and
development trees by using a transaction-based approach to version control,
along with a web-browsable repository and an integrated testing
mechanism.
