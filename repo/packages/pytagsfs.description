Maps media files to an arbitrary directory structure
	
pytagsfs is a fuse filesystem that arranges media files in a virtual directory
structure based on the file tags.

a set of audio files could be mapped to a new directory structure organizing
them hierarchically by album, genre, release date, etc.

file tags can be changed by moving and renaming virtual files and directories.
the virtual files can be modified, opened and played just like regular files.
