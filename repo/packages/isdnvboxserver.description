Isdn utilities - answering machine server
	
let your debian system be your answering machine! messages can be accessed
remotely, automatically emailed, etc.

this package provides the vbox server, which must be installed on the
system with the isdn card. to actually listen to the recorded messages
you need the client package (isdnvboxclient) somewhere, not necessarily on
the same system.
