Scalable library for eigenvalue problem computations
	
slepc is a software library for the solution of large scale sparse eigenvalue
problems on parallel computers. it is an extension of petsc and can be used
for either standard or generalized eigenproblems, with real or complex
arithmetic. it can also be used for computing a partial svd of a large,
sparse, rectangular matrix.

this package contains the shared libraries for slepc.
