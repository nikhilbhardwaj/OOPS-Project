Infinote-based collaborative editing - debugging symbols
	
libinfinity is library to build collaborative text editors.  changes
to the text buffers are synced to all other clients over a central server.
even though a central server is involved, the local user sees his changes
applied instantly and the merging is done on the individual clients.

these are the debugging symbols for libinfinity, needed only if you try
to debug an application using it.
