A simple "encryption" tool
	
this is a simple "encryption" tool to work with common simple encryption
algorithms (rot13, caesar, vigen√®re, ...)

gcipher does not provide any strong encryption and should not be used to
encrypt any private data.

gcipher can run as either a gui, a command-line application, or a network
proxy.
