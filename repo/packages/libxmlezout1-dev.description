Easy-to-use library for emitting xml from ada programs, dev files
	
xml ez out is a small set of packages intended to aid the creation of
xml-formatted output from within ada programs. it basically wraps the tags and
data provided to it with xml syntax and writes them to a user-supplied medium.

this medium can be any sort of writable entity, such as a file, a
memory buffer, or even a communications link, such as a socket. the
only functionality required of the medium is that it supply a
meaningful "put" (for writing a string) and "new_line" procedure.

this package contains file needed to develop applications with xml ez out.
