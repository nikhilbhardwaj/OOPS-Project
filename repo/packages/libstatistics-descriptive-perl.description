Perl module for basic descriptive statistical functions
	
statistics::descriptive provides basic functions used in descriptive
statistics. it has an object oriented design and supports two
different types of data storage and calculation objects: sparse and
full. with the sparse method, none of the data is stored and only a
few statistical measures are available. using the full method, the
entire data set is retained and additional functions are available.
