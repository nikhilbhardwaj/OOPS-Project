Old school 2d-scrolling shooter
	
ketm is a hicolor/hiresolution classical game that has similarities with
raptor, tyrian and galaga. you are a spacepilot controlling your secret
prototype ship. at regular interval's you get attacked by the bad guys. you
have a mission to clean this sector from them (i.e. kill everything that
moves). be sure to pick up some weapon and ship upgrades on the way.
