An opengl kde screensaver with lightning and comets
	
kcometen4 is an opengl kde screensaver. a variety of multi-colored comets
bounce inside a room until they explode. occasionally lightning will also
strike and blow them up. meanwhile a free-floating camera watches the action
and sometimes enteres a "bullet time" mode.
