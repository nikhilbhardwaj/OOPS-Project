C++ network libraries for rapid application development
	
wvstreams is a library suite that is comprised of several parts.  included
in the extras package are:

 * wvipstreams: which includes wvtcpstream and wvudpstream
 * wvcrypto streams: a really easy way to add ssl support to applications


these are the base classes used to build programs such as the ever popular
wvdial, tunnelvision, fastforward, kwvdial, retchmail, and many more yet
to come.  ;)
