Perl module for ip validation
	
data::validate::ip collects ip validation routines to make input validation
and untainting easier and more readable. all functions return an untainted
value if the test passes, and undef if it fails. this means that you should
always check for a defined status explicitly. don't assume the return value
will be true.
