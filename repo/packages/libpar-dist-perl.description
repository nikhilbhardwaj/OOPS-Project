Perl module to create and manipulate par distributions
	
par::dist module creates and manipulates par distributions. they are
architecture-specific par files, containing everything under blib/ of cpan
distributions after their make or build stage, a meta.yml describing metadata
of the original cpan distribution, and a manifest detailing all files within
it. digitally signed par distributions will also contain a signature file.
