Performance co-pilot domain agent library and headers
	
the libpcp-pmda-dev package contains the performance co-pilot (pcp)
library and header files needed to develop performance metric domain
agents (pmdas).  each pmda exports performance data for one domain;
for example the operating system kernel, cisco routers, a database,
an application, etc.

the performance co-pilot provides a unifying abstraction for
all of the interesting performance data in a system, and allows
client applications to easily retrieve and process any subset of
that data.
