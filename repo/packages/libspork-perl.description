Create slide presentations with kwiki markup
	
spork lets you create html slideshow presentations easily. it comes with a
sample slideshow. all you need is a text editor, a browser and a topic.

spork allows you create an entire slideshow by editing a single file called
spork.slides (by default). each slide is created using a minimal markup
language similar to the syntax used in kwiki wikis.
