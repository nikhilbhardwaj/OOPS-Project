Program for reception and transmission of qrss/dfcw signals
	
glfer is composed of two main parts:
a spectrogram window, where you can see the spectrum of the received
signal vs. time and transmission functions, to emit cw characters at
a slow but precisely controlled speed, using the qrss (slow cw) or
dfcw (dual frequency cw) modes.
