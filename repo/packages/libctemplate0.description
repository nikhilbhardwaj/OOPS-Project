A simple but powerful template language for c++
	
this package contains a library implementing a simple but
powerful template language for c++.  it emphasizes separating logic
from presentation: it is impossible to embed application logic in this
template language.  this limits the power of the template language
without limiting the power of the template *system*.  indeed, google's
"main" web search uses this system exclusively for formatting output.
