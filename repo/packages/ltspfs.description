Fuse based remote filesystem for ltsp thin clients
	
ltspfs is a remote filesystem consisting of two parts:
1) a network server daemon that runs on the ltsp terminal.
2) a fuse module that runs in userspace on the server, that connects with
the daemon on the client.

this package contains the userspace parts for the ltsp server.
