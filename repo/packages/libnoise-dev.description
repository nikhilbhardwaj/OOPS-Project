A portable, coherent noise-generating library for c++
	
libnoise is a portable c++ library that is used to generate coherent noise,
a type of smoothly-changing noise. libnoise can generate perlin noise,
ridged multifractal noise, and other types of coherent-noise. coherent noise
is often used by graphics programmers to generate natural-looking textures,
planetary terrain, and other things.

this package contains the headers and static libraries needed to build
programs using libnoise.
