Lossy compression and denoising
	
the program wzip is a preprocessor for lossy data compression.
a sequence of ascii floating-point numbers is transformed into a sequence
of small integers ready for effective compression with e.g. gzip.
the program can also be used for effective but time consuming denoising
of measurement data. wzip was originally written for the processing of
edx-linescans.
