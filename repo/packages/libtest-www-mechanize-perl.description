Module for testing web applications
	
test::www::mechanize is a perl module framework for testing web applications.
it extends the functionality of www::mechanize (see libwww-mechanize-perl) by
subclassing it, providing additional features for testing web applications.
in particular, it provides much nicer diagnostics upon failure.
