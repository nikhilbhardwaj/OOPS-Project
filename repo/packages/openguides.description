A web application for managing a collaboratively-written city guide
	
the openguides software provides the framework for a collaboratively-written
city guide.  it is similar to a wiki but provides somewhat more structured
data storage allowing you to annotate wiki pages with information such as
category, location, and much more.  it provides searching facilities
including "find me everything within a certain distance of this place".
every page includes a link to a machine-readable (rdf) version of the page.
