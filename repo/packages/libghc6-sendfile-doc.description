Haskell portable sendfile library - documentation
	
this haskell library exposes zero-copy sendfile functionality in a
portable way. sendfile is a non standard system call that copies data
between one file descriptor and another. this library uses the native
implementations where possible (for example, under linux or freebsd) and
provides an haskell replacement in other cases, thus providing a
portable interface.

this package contains the library documentation.
