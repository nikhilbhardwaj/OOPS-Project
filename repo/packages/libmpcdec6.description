Musepack decoder - library
	
musepack is an audio compression format with a strong emphasis on
high quality. it's not lossless, but it is designed for transparency,
so that you won't be able to hear differences between the original
wave file and the much smaller mpc file.

it is based on the mpeg-1 layer-2 / mp2 algorithms, but since 1997
it has rapidly developed and vastly improved and is now at an advanced
stage in which it contains heavily optimized and patentless code.
