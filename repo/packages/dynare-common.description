Platform independent files for dynare
	
dynare is a pre-preprocessor and a collection of gnu octave and
matlab routines which can solve, simulate and estimate non-linear
models with forward looking variables.

in particular, in the field of computational economics, it is used
for solving and estimating dynamic stochastic general equilibrium
(dsge) models.

this package contains the various m-files which can be run under
both gnu octave and matlab.
