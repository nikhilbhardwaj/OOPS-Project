Tinyfugue mud client for tinymuds, dikumuds, and lpmuds
	
tinyfugue (also known as "fugue" or "tf") is a line-based client
designed for connecting to mud servers (note: lp, diku, and other
servers which use prompts require "/lp on"; see /help prompts).

tinyfugue is larger than most mud clients, but has many more features
and is much more flexible. the goal is to provide the most
functionality in a client that still maintains the user-friendliness
of tinytalk.
