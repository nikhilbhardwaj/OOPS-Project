Device-mapper software raid support tool - shared library
	
dmraid discovers, activates, deactivates and displays properties
of software raid sets (eg, ataraid) and contained dos partitions.

dmraid uses the linux device-mapper to create devices with respective
mappings for the ataraid sets discovered.

this package contains the dmraid shared library, which implements
the back half of dmraid, including on-disk metadata formats.
