Cdbs modules for building configuration packages
	
this package contains a system of cdbs modules for creating debian
configuration packages: packages that configure an existing debian
system by using dpkg-divert on configuration files.  these modules
attempt to make the process of creating configuration packages
efficient by checking the md5sums of upstream configuration files
that are to be modified and automatically generating the relevant
postinst code to perform the diversions using the standard debhelper
mechanism.

the config-package-dev modules are optimized for site defaults (i.e.
configuration for a university or a company), though they are useful
for other applications as well.
