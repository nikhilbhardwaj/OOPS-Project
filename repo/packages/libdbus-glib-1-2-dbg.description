Simple interprocess messaging system (glib library debug symbols)
	
d-bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and corba in
terms of complexity.

this package provides support for debugging programs that use the glib-based
shared library.

see the dbus description for more information about d-bus in general.
