Device firmware update (dfu) based usb programmer for atmel chips
	
a linux based command-line programmer for atmel chips with a usb
bootloader supporting in system programming.

this is a mostly device firmware update (dfu) 1.0 compliant
user-space application. this program was created because the atmel
flip program for flashing devices does not run on linux and because
standard dfu loaders do not work for atmel chips.

see http://dfu-programmer.sourceforge.net/ for more information.
