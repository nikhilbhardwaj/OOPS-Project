Developer's manual for catalyst
	
catalyst is an elegant web application framework, extremely flexible yet
extremely simple. it's similar to ruby on rails, spring (java) and maypole,
upon which it was originally based.

catalyst follows the model-view-controller (mvc) design pattern, allowing you
to easily separate concerns, like content, presentation, and flow control,
into separate modules. this separation allows you to modify code that handles
one concern without affecting code that handles the others. catalyst promotes
the re-use of existing perl modules that already handle common web application
concerns well.
