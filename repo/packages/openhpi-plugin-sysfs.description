Openhpi plugin module for the sysfs filesystem
	
openhpi is an implementation of the service availability forum's hardware
platform interface specification.  (see http://www.saforum.org)  as
such, openhpi facilitates the development of computer manageability
applications which are not tied to a single hardware vendor's products.

this package contains a plugin module that accesses hardware information
presented through the sysfs filesystem.
