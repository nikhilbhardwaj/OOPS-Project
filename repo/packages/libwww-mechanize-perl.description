Module to automate interaction with websites
	
www::mechanize, or mech for short, helps you automate interaction with
a website. it supports performing a sequence of page fetches including
following links and submitting forms. each fetched page is parsed and
its links and forms are extracted. a link or a form can be selected, form
fields can be filled and the next page can be fetched. mech also stores
a history of the urls you've visited, which can be queried and revisited.
