Jdbc command-line utility for issuing sql
	
sqlline is a pure-java console based utility for connecting to
relational databases and executing sql commands.

it is similar to other command-line database access utilities like
sqlplus for oracle, mysql for mysql, and isql for sybase/sql server.

since it is pure-java, it is platform independent, and will run on
any platform that can run java 1.3 or higher.
