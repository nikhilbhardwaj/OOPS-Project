Lua http 1.1 web server
	
this package contains xavante, a lua http 1.1 web server that uses a modular
architecture based on uri mapped handlers. xavante currently offers a file
handler, a redirect handler and a cgilua handler. those are used for general
files, uri remapping and cgilua scripts respectively.

the cgilua handler is considered optional thus xavante just recommends the
packages needed for that handler.
