Parallel console shell for administering clusters
	
pconsole allows you to connect to each node of your cluster simultaneously,
and you can type your administrative commands in a specialized window that
'multiplies' the input to each of the connections you have opened.
pconsole is best run from within x windows, although it is possible to
employ it without x (in console mode) as well.
you need to install pconsole on only 1 machine in the cluster, this would
usually be your central administrative node.
