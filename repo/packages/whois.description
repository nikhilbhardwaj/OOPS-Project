An intelligent whois client
	
this is a new whois (rfc 3912) client rewritten from scratch.
it is inspired from and compatible with the usual bsd and ripe whois(1)
programs.
it is intelligent and can automatically select the appropriate whois
server for most queries.

the package also contains mkpasswd, a features-rich front end to crypt(3).
