Module for more shorter data::dumper-like output
	
data::dumper::concise is a perl module designed to produce useful debugging
output, eliding unnecessary information. it exists as a convenient way to
reproduce a set of dumper options useful for most applications.

a similar module, data::dump::streamer (libdata-dump-streamer-perl) provides
even shorter output but is overkill for most applications. in comparison,
this module is pure perl, which means it is less likely to segfault.
