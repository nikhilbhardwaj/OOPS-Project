Transformers for reader and state monoids; profiling libraries
	
this package provides a library for the haskell programming language
compiled for profiling.
see http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on haskell.

this library provides monoid transformers for the reader monoid and
the state monoid. there's no monoid transformer for the writer monoid
since the writer monad transforms a monoid into a monad.
