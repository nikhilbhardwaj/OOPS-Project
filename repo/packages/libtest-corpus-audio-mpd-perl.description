Module to fake mpd for testing purposes
	
test::corpus::audio::mpd is a perl test harness that tries to launch a new
music player daemon (mpd) server using a fake mpd.conf file with correct
paths for testing.

if an mpd server is already running, this module will stop it temporarily if
the mpd_test_override environment variable is true; otherwise, the test will
bail. once the tests are complete, the temporarily launched mpd server will
be shut down and the original one relaunched (if there was one).
