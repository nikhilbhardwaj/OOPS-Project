Library for dealing with microsoft chm files
	
it is a very simple library, but sufficient for dealing with all of the chm
files. library currently does not has write support.

chm files are used on the microsoft windows platform to store program
documentation, almost always in the form of html, with some non-standard

(itsf) files and contain some special files to implement features of the
chm viewer.
