Utility to create a file list suitable for making backups
	
rdup is a utility inspired by rsync and the plan9 way of doing
things. rdup itself does not backup anything. it only prints a list
of files that are changed, or all files in case of a null dump. it
also handles files that are removed, allowing for correct incremental
backups.
