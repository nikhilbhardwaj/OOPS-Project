Gtk2::treeview renderer for data::treedumper
	
this widget is the gui equivalent of data::treedumper; it will display a perl
data structure in a treeview, allowing you to fold and unfold child data
structures and get a quick feel for what's where. right-clicking anywhere in
the view brings up a context menu, from which the user can choose to expand
or collapse all items.
