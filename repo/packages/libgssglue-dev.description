Header files and docs for libgssglue
	
contains the header files and documentation for libgssglue
for use in developing applications that use the libgssglue library.

libgssglue provides a gssapi interface, but does not implement any
gssapi mechanisms itself; instead it calls other gssapi functions
(e.g., those provided by mit kerberos), depending on the requested
mechanism, to do the work.
