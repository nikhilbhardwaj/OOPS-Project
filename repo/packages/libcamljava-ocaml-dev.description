Interface between ocaml and java via caml/c interface and jni
	
camljava is an interface between ocaml and java allowing programs written in
one of the two languages to call code written in the other.

interaction among the two languages happen via the respective c interfaces:
caml/c interface for ocaml and jni (java native interface) for java.

currently, camljava provides a low-level, weakly-typed ocaml interface very
similar to the jni. java object references are mapped to an abstract type, and
various jni-like operations are provided to allow java method invocation,
field access, and more.

a basic callback facility (allowing java code to invoke methods on ocaml
objects) is also provided, although some stub java code must be written by
hand.

this package contain all the development stuff needed to use camljava from
ocaml programs.
