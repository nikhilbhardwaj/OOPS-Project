Module for storing multidimensional hash structures in perl tied hashes
	
the mldbm perl module can be used to store multidimensional hash structures
in tied hashes (including dbm files).

it depends on the data::dumper module and by default uses the
sdbm tied hash. but you can use it with db_file (and others
dbm modules). you can also use other serializing packages
like storable and freezethaw.
