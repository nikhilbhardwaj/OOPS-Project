Latex class for presentations
	
chaksem is a latex2e class for slides.  based on seminar, it adds
support for running footers as well as itemised and numbered lists,
with a layout that fits nicely to the sans serif font used for text.
there is support for overlays, which includes the ability to accumulate
text and images on the slides for online presentations.  printable
lecture notes with collapsed overlays are also able to be generated from
this class.
