Apple powerbook power management daemon
	
pmud is a daemon which periodically polls the pmu
(power manager) and performs functions such as enabling
or disabling devices appropriately when the power source
changes, or putting the computer into sleep mode when the
remaining battery power drops below a critical threshold.
additional tools include a sleep command and a tool for
waking up media bay devices to work around a cd-rom wakeup
bug in old kernels.
