Xorg x server - development files
	
this package provides development files for the x.org ('xorg') x server.
this is not quite the same as the ddk (driver development kit) from the
xfree86 4.x and x.org 6.7, 6.8 and 6.9 series of servers; it provides
headers and a pkg-config file for drivers using autotools to build
against.

unless you are developing or building a driver, you probably want
xserver-xorg and/or xserver-xorg-core instead.

more information about x.org can be found at:
<url:http://www.x.org>

this package is built from the x.org xserver module.
