Network audio system - development files
	
the network audio system (nas) was developed by ncd for playing,
recording, and manipulating audio data over a network. like the x
window system, it uses the client/server model to separate
applications from the specific drivers that control audio input and
output devices.

this package contains the header files and static library (libaudio.a),
needed for development of programs using nas.
