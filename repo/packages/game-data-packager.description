Installer for game data files
	
various games are divided into two logical parts: engine
and data. often the engine and data are licenced in
different ways, such that only one half can be distributed
in debian.

game-data-packager is a tool which builds .deb files for game
data which cannot be distributed in debian (such as
commercial game data).

at the moment, game-data-packager has support for building debs
for doom games (doom, doom 2 and final doom).
