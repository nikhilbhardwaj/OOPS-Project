Perl enhancement to carp error logging facilities
	
carp::clan is a perl module designed to report errors from the perspective
of the caller of a "clan" of modules, similar to "carp" itself. instead of
giving it a number of levels to skip on the calling stack, you give it a
pattern to characterize the package names of the "clan" of modules which
shall never be blamed for any error.

these modules stick together like a "clan" and any error which occurs will
be blamed on the "outsider" script or modules not belonging to this clan.
