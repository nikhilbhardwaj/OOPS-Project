An http/1.1 server framework
	
twisted.web2 is the next generation web server framework built with
twisted. web2 is under active development and it's apis should not be
considered stable at this point. it is not a version of twisted.web
and with that in mind compatibility is not of the highest concern,
though the compatibility layer does support many but not all
twisted.web resources.
