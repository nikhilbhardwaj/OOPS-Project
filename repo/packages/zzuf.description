Transparent application fuzzer
	
zzuf is a transparent fuzzer. it works by intercepting applications' file
and network operations and changing random bits in their input. its behaviour
is deterministic, making it easy to reproduce bugs.

zzuf has support for variable fuzzing ratio, character filtering, fuzzing
decision based on filenames and optional network fuzzing. it can also stop
processes that run for too long or that output too much data.
