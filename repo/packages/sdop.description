Simplified docbook processor
	
sdop (simple docbook processor) reads a simplified docbook xml file, processes
it into typeset pages, and outputs the result as postscript (which can easily
be converted to a pdf). it is "simple" because it supports only a subset of
docbook, and also because it does not make use of a dtd or stylesheets or any
other heavyweight apparatus. it is a single program.  sdop is used to format
the exim reference manual.
