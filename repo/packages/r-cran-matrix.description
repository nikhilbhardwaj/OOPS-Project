Gnu r package of classes for dense and sparse matrices
	
this cran package provides s4 classes and methods for numerical
linear algebra using dense or sparse matrices.  the sparse matrix
implementation uses code from the ldl sparse matrix package and
code from the metis package of partitioning algorithms.
