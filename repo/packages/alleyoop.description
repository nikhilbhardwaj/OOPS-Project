Front-end to the valgrind memory checker
	
alleyoop is a gnome front-end to the valgrind memory checker, including
features like intelligently suppressing errors and launching editors at
the error position in the source code.

valgrind helps you to find memory-management problems in your programs.
when a program is run under valgrind's supervision, all reads and
writes of memory are checked, and calls to malloc/new/free/delete are
intercepted.
