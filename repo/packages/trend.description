A general-purpose, efficient trend graph
	
trend is a general-purpose, efficient trend graph for "live" data. data
is read in ascii form from a file or continuously from a fifo and
displayed in real-time into a multi-pass trend (much like a crt
oscilloscope). trend can be used as a rapid analysis tool for
progressive or time-based data series together with trivial scripting.
