Perl distribution builder
	
dist::zilla builds distributions of code to be uploaded to the cpan. in this
respect, it is like extutils::makemaker, module::build, or module::install.
unlike those tools, however, it is not also a system for installing code that
has been downloaded from the cpan. since it's only run by authors, and is
meant to be run on a repository checkout rather than on published, released
code, it can do much more than those tools, and is free to make much more
ludicrous demands in terms of prerequisites.
