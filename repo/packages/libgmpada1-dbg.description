Ada binding to the gnu multiprecision library: debug symbols
	
gmpada allows programmers to use the gnu multiprecision library
within the ada language: unbounded integers, rationals and
floats. experimental support for mpfr's better float rounding is
provided.

this package contains the runtime debug symbols.
