Lightweight implementation of template toolkit
	
template::tiny is a reimplementation of a partial subset of the template
toolkit, in as few lines of code as possible.

it is intended for use in light-usage, low-memory, or low-cpu templating
situations, where you may need to upgrade to the full feature set in the
future, or if you want the familiarity of tt-style templates.

note: this module is experimental and subject to change without notice.
