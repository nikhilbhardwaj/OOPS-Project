Generate publication quality graphs
	
rlplot is a gui based program for displaying scientific data in
standard formats. it has full support for all error-bar types and
it has greater flexibility with displaying colour and texture in
charts than gnuplot (filled bar chart boxes are possible without
any additional programs). output is generated on the x display where
further changes can be made to the graph using point and click methods.
images can be exported as scalable vector graphics (svg) as well as
eps, wmf and tiff formats.
