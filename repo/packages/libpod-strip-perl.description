Remove pod documentation from perl code
	
pod::strip is a subclass of pod::simple that removes the pod (plain old
documentation) from perl code. the pod may optionally be replaced with
comments so that line numbers of the code stay the same.

pod::strip is useful in perl code parsers that don't want to bother about pod.
