Emacs major mode for editing prolog code
	
this is a replacement for the standard emacs prolog mode. it comes
with all the features you would expect, including syntax
highlighting, auto indent, and full interaction with an inferior
prolog process.

this mode supports in principle any prolog system, though it is
primarily maintained for swi prolog. it also has some special tweaks
for gnu prolog and sicstus prolog, and explicitly supports prolog's
close relatives eclipse and mercury.
