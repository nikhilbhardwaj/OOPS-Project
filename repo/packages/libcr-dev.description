Development files for blcr
	
blcr (berkeley lab checkpoint/restart) allows programs running on
linux to be "checkpointed" (written entirely to a file), and then
later "restarted".

blcr can checkpoint both single- and multithreaded (pthreads)
programs linked with the nptl implementation of pthreads. blcr is
also able to save and restore groups of related processes together
with the pipes that connect them.

blcr can checkpoint and restore (most) un-modified programs,
however blcr aware applications can customise this process
further.

this package contains headers and files needed to compile
applications that work with blcr.
