A speedy filetransfer and network diagnostic program
	
netsend transmits and receives files. it is highly configurable and offers
the transport protocols tcp, dccp, udp, udplite and sctp using either
ipv4 or ipv6 on the network layer. the cluster protocol tipc is also
supported.

the user is able to tweak various options of the linux network stack
to gain maximum performance. while this is not needed for trivial
filetransfer, it is valuable for network protocol performance
testing.
