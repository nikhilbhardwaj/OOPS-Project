Simplified debian package management front end
	
wajig is a single commandline wrapper around apt, apt-cache, dpkg,
/etc/init.d scripts and more, intended to be easy to use and providing
extensive documentation for all of its functions.

with a suitable sudo(1) configuration, most (if not all) package installation
as well as creation tasks can be done from a user shell. wajig is also
suitable for general system administration.

a gnome gui command 'gjig' is also included in the package.
