Support files for building ascii ptex
	
this package actually contains a fragment of the latest tetex source
tarball(will be placed in /usr/src).  since ascii ptex is provided as a set
of additional source files to tetex source tree, you need to install this
package when you build ptex-bin package.  a little shell script to
strip down big tetex source tarball is also included.

you don't need to install this package to have a running ptex system.
