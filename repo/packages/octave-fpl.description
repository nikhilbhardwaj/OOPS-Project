Plot data on unstructured triangular and tetrahedral meshes in octave
	
fpl is a collection of routines for plotting  data on finite element
method (fem) meshes.  it provides routines for outputing files and
displaying data in opendx (ibm visualization data explorer) and vtk
(visualization toolkit) formats.  it allows displays of triangular
and tetrahedral meshes, as well as scalar and 2d vector fields.

this octave add-on package is part of the octave-forge project.
