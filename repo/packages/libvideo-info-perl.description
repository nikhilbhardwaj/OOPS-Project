Perl module to examine video files
	
video::info is a module for working with video files. it can open files and
determine its most likely type, then extract information such as play length,
bitrate, resolution, dimensions, etc.

currently there is support for mpeg, avi, asf and riff. there is quicktime
support in the upstream module which has been disabled in debian because
there is no current package for openquicktime. if you would like to see
support for this, please file a bug report.
