Create debian packages from drupal modules and themes
	
the purpose of this program is to generate debian packages for any drupal
projects (that is, modules or themes).

given that drupal developers publish their work through the main drupal
site (http://drupal.org), this program fetches the information for the
latest available versions (for the right drupal release, and with the
specified stability level), and prepares a debian package from it.
