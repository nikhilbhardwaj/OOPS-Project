Console that can be added to any sdl application
	
this library provides a console similar to the consoles in quake and other
games but with lots of added features.

a console is meant to be a very simple way of interacting with a program
and executing commands. commands are linked to the console with callback
functions so that when a command is typed in, a specific function is
executed automatically.

this package contains the libsdl-console runtime library.
