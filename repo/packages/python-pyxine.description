Interface to the xine media player for python
	
pyxine provides python bindings for libxine, the backend of the xine
media player. using pyxine, it is possible to write simple (or
complex) user-interfaces to xine. this makes it much easier for one
to write custom xine uis. pyxine can also be used as a generic audio
and video playing library for python.
