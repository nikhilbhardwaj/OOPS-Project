Index and search pods using x<> entries
	
the pod-index distribution includes various modules for indexing and
searching pod that is appropriately marked with x<> pod codes.

pod::index, as a module, does nothing. everything is done by
pod::index::builder, pod::index::search, and other helper modules.
