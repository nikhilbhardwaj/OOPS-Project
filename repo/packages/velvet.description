Nucleic acid sequence assembler for very short reads
	
velvet is a de novo genomic assembler specially designed for short read
sequencing technologies, such as solexa or 454, developed by daniel zerbino and
ewan birney at the european bioinformatics institute (embl-ebi), near
cambridge, in the united kingdom.

velvet currently takes in short read sequences, removes errors then produces
high quality unique contigs. it then uses paired read information, if
available, to retrieve the repeated areas between contigs.
