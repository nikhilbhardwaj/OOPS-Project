Linux scsi tape driver aware magnetic tape control (aka mt)
	
mt-st contains a version of "mt" that is aware of linux's scsi tape
driver. mt-st is able to set some esoteric control flags like tape partitions.

mt-st diverts (replaces) the gnu version of mt, in the cpio package.

it also comes with stinit, a program to be run at boot time to set up
tape defaults.
