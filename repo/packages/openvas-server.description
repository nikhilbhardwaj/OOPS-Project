Remote network security auditor - server
	
the open vulnerability assessment system is a modular security auditing
tool, used for testing remote systems for vulnerabilities that should be
fixed.

it is made up of two parts: a server, and a client. the server/daemon,
openvasd, is in charge of the attacks, whereas the client,
openvas-client, provides an x11/gtk+ user interface.

this package provides the server.
