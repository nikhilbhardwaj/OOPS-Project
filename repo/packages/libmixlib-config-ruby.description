A simple class based config mechanism for ruby
	
mixlib-config provides a class based object to store and manipulate
configuration values. a file can be read in to populate the object,
and values can be set and read from the internal hash using methods.

this package is a dependency package, which depends on the package
containing actual ruby mixlib-config libraries for the default ruby version
(currently 1.8).
