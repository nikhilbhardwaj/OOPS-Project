the main features of the elf shell library are :


 * full api for all elf structures.
 * et_rel injection into et_exec/et_dyn elf files.
 * altgot redirection technique, for external functions redirections on risc
   architectures.
 * altplt redirection technique, for external functions redirections.
 * cflow redirection technique, for internal functions redirections.
 * extplt partial relinking technique, for adding unknown extern symbols to
   the program.
 * extstatic static file relinking technique.
