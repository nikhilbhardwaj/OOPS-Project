A c++ template library for the analysis of sequences
	
seqan is a c++ template library of efficient algorithms and data
structures for the analysis of sequences with the focus on
biological data. this library applies a unique generic design that
guarantees high performance, generality, extensibility, and
integration with other libraries. seqan is easy to use and
simplifies the development of new software tools with a minimal loss
of performance. this package contains the applications dfi, pair_align,
micro_razers, seqan_tcoffee, seqcons, razers and tree_recon.
