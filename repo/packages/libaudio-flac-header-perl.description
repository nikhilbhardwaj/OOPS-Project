Perl interface to flac file header metadata
	
audio::flac::header provides an object-oriented interface to flac file header
and metadata, it returns a hash containing basic information about a flac
file, a representation of the embedded cue sheet if one exists, as well as tag
information contained in the flac file's vorbis tags.

there is no complete list of tag keys for vorbis tags, as they can be
defined by the user; the basic set of tags used for flac files include:
album, artist, title, date, genre, tracknumber, comment.
