Lpeg library for the lua language version 5.1
	
lpeg is a new pattern-matching library for lua, based on parsing expression
grammars (pegs). pegs look similar to regular expressions or context-free
grammars in backus-naur form (bnf) notation. pegs make a good replacement for
regular expressions, because they are strictly more powerful. for example, a
regular expression inherently cannot find matched pairs of parentheses, because
it is not recursive, but a peg can.
