Haskell library for binary serialisation using lazy bytestrings
	
binary serialisation of haskell values to and from lazy bytestrings.
the binary library provides methods for encoding haskell values as
streams of bytes directly in memory. the resulting bytestring can
then be written to disk, sent over the network, or futher processed
(for example, compressed with gzip).

the 'binary' package is notable in that it provides both pure, and
high performance serialisation.

values are always encoded in network order (big endian) form, and
encoded data should be portable across machine endianess, word size,
or compiler version. for example, data encoded using the binary class
could be written from ghc, and read back in hugs.
