Daemon to lock files into ram
	
when a system starts paging excessively it may be impossible for the sysadmin
to login for the purpose of killing the runaway processes (sometimes the
login program times out due to thrashing).  memlockd allows important system
files (such as /bin/login, /bin/getty, and the admin shell) to be locked in
memory so that there will be no delay in accessing executable pages.  in my
tests this can decrease the time required for the administrator to login on a
thrashing system by a factor of more than 3.
