Apache2 module to speed up perl scripts by making them persistent
	
speedycgi is a way to run perl scripts persistently, which usually makes
them run much more quickly because it avoids the overhead of starting
up a new perl interpreter and compiling the perl code.

this package provides an apache2 module so that speedycgi scripts can be run
without the overhead of doing a fork/exec for each request. please note that
this package only works with apache2's prefork mpm or the itk mpm, as it is
not thread-safe.
