Helper module for fastcgi
	
fcgi is a simple perl module for writing fastcgi applications. fastcgi is a
language-independent, scalable, open extension to cgi that provides faster
performance by keeping programs persistent in memory and allowing them to
handle multiple requests. this module provides the core interface needed to
write these applications.

for complex applications, you should consider a more full-featured solution
such as plack or catalyst (see libcatalyst-perl).
