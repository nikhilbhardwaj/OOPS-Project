Build system used for embedded linux distributions
	
bitbake is a simple tool for the execution of tasks. it is derived from
portage, which is the package management system used by the gentoo linux
distribution.
it is most commonly used to build packages, as it can easily use its
rudimentary inheritence to abstract common operations, such as fetching
sources, unpacking them, patching them, compiling them, and so on.
it is the basis of the openembedded project, which is being used for
openzaurus, familiar and a number of other linux distributions.
