Simple utility to limit a process's absolute execution time
	
the timelimit utility executes a command and terminates the spawned process
after a given time with a given signal.  a "warning" signal is sent first,
then, after a timeout, a "kill" signal, similar to the way init(8) operates
on shutdown.
