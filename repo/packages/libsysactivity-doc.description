Retrieves statistics of the system's activity (development doc)
	
a lightweight library that retrieves statistics of the system's
activity in a portable and thread safe way. in each os that it
supports it offers the same api for retrieving the activity of:


 * hard disks
 * cpus memory
 * processes
 * network interfaces.


this package contains the development api documentation. non-developers
likely have little use for this package.
