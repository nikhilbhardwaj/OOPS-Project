Utilities for devices using the scsi command set
	
most oses have scsi pass-through interfaces that enable user space programs
to send scsi commands to a device and fetch the response. with scsi to ata
translation (sat) many ata disks now can process scsi commands. typically
each utility in this package implements one scsi command. see the draft
standards at www.t10.org for scsi command definitions plus sat. ata
commands are defined in the draft standards at www.t13.org . for a mapping
between supported scsi and ata commands and utility names in this package
see the coverage file.
