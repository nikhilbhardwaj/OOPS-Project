Diffusion-weighted mri white matter tractography
	
set of tools to perform diffusion-weighted mri white matter tractography of the
brain in the presence of crossing fibres, using constrained spherical
deconvolution, and a probabilisitic streamlines algorithm. magnetic resonance
images in dicom, analyze, or uncompressed nifti format are supported.
