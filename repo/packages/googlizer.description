Utility to search google via your gnome menu/panel
	
this is a very simple and very handy utility that just spawns the
configured gnome browser with a google search on whatever you have in
the x clipboard (whatever you last selected). it's not even an applet,
just a program with a launcher that's nice to put on the panel - drag
it there from the menu. it also includes support for a command line
option -u/--url, to specify an alternative url to which the search
should be appended before opening.
