Development files for cbflib
	
cbflib is a library of ansi-c functions providing a simple mechanism for
accessing crystallographic binary files (cbf files) and image-supporting
cif (imgcif) files. the cbflib api is loosely based on the cifparse api for
mmcif files. cbflib does not perform any semantic integrity checks and
simply provides functions to create, read, modify and write cbf
binary data files and imgcif ascii data files.

this package contains libraries and header files for program development.
