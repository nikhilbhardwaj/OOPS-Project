Library for dealing with sequences of unicode characters
	
ocaml-text is an ocaml library for dealing with "text", i.e. sequences
of unicode characters, in a convenient way. it supports:

 * encoding/decoding of text;
 * functions for manipulation of utf-8 encoded strings, such as
   validation and most of the functions from "list" and "string"
   modules of the ocaml standard library, adapted for utf-8 strings;
 * locale-specific text functions (compare, upper, is_alpha, ...).


it is composed of two modules:

 * "encoding" for encoding/decoding text
 * "text" for text manipulation


this package contains all the development stuff you need to use the
ocaml-text library in your programs.
