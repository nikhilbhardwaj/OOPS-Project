Proxy server for the last.fm radio streams
	
lastfmproxy allows you to use your regular old audio player
to listen to the last.fm streams. it does this by acting as
a player itself, connecting to the server on your behalf,
but instead of playing the stream, it simply relays it to
whichever other application connecting to it.
