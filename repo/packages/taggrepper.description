Search and match tags of audio files against regular expressions
	
taggrepper is a small tool written to "grep" tags of audio
files. currently, it can be used to match some or any tags of mp3,
ogg vorbis and flac files, against specified regular expressions, and
display the name and designated fields of the matching files. it
supports recursive directory searches as well.
