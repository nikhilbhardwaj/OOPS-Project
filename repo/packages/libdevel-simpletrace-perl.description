Perl helper to see where your code warns and dies using stack traces
	
devel::simpletrace can be used to more easily spot the place where a program
or a module generates errors. its use is extremely simple, reduced to just
useing it.

this is achieved by modifying the functions warn() and die() in order to
replace the standard messages by complete stack traces that precisely
indicates how and where the error or warning occurred. other than this, their
use should stay unchanged, even when using die() inside eval().
