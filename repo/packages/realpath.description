Return the canonicalized absolute pathname
	
the package contains a small utility realpath, which converts each
pathname argument to an absolute pathname, which has no components
that are symbolic links or the special .  or ..  directory entries.

this utility provides mostly the same functionality as `/bin/readlink -f'
in the coreutils package.
