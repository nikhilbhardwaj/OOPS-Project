webxml is a tool to easily edit web application descriptors (web.xml) used in
tomcat and other java application servers.

it supports the following tags:
<servlet>, <servlet-name>, <display-name>, <description>,
<servlet-class>, <init-param>, <servlet-mapping>, <url-pattern>.
these tags are basic and most of them are indispensable for every web
application.
