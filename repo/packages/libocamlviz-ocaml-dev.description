Real-time profiling tools for objective caml (library)
	
ocamlviz gives the ability to instrument an existing code, in real
time, with lightweight monitoring annotations. ocamlviz can also be
used as a debugging tool.

here are a few possibilities provided by ocamlviz:

 * observe details about the garbage collector
 * observe how many times the program goes through a point
 * make a set of values (any) and count its cardinal number and its
   size in the heap
 * observe how much time passed between two points of the program
 * observe the value of integers, floating-point numbers, booleans
   and strings
 * observe details about hash tables, like the number of empty
   buckets, or the filling rate
 * etc


this package provides the ocamlviz library.
