An original two-player color puzzle game
	
atom-4 is a two-player color manipulation game played with colored
spherical pieces on a board divided into equilateral triangles. the
player who first makes a row of 4 pieces of the right color wins.
however, the players do not directly play pieces of the winning color;
they must construct their winning pieces via color changes that happen
to neighbouring pieces whenever a new piece is placed on the board.

atom-4 supports both a curses-based text interface and an x11 interface.
