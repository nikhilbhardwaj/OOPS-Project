Gconf database cleaner
	
gconf cleaner is a tool to clean your gconf database up that
is possibly cluttered with unnecessary or invalid keys.

this tools scans the user's gconf database and lists the keys that are not
associated with a schema (i.e. they are likely no longer useful). then it
allows the user to backup these keys and remove them from the database.
