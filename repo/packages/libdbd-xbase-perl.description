Perl module to access xbase files (optionally through dbi)
	
this module allows creation, access and modification of .dbf (dbase,
clipper, fox* style) database files. it is capable of handling memo
files, but indexes only in a somewhat limited way. it has two
interfaces: one using sql commands (through dbi) ad the other with a
simple oo interface.

you can use the included dbf_dump program to dump the content of a .dbf file.
