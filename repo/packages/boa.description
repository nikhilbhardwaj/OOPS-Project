Lightweight and high performance web server
	
boa is a single-tasking http server. that means that unlike
traditional web servers, it does not fork for each incoming
connection, nor does it fork many copies of itself to handle multiple
connections. it internally multiplexes all of the ongoing http
connections, and forks only for cgi programs (which must be separate
processes). preliminary tests show boa is capable of handling several
hundred hits per second on a 100 mhz pentium.
