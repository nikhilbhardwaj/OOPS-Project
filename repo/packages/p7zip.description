7zr file archiver with high compression ratio
	
p7zip is the unix port of 7-zip, a file archiver that archives with
very high compression ratios.

p7zip provides:

 - /usr/bin/7zr
   a standalone minimal version of the 7-zip tool that only handles
   7z archives. 7z compression is 30-50% better than zip compression.
 - /usr/bin/p7zip
   a gzip like wrapper around 7zr.


p7zip-full provides 7z and 7za which support more compression formats.
