75 dpi unicode cyrillic fonts for x (cyr-rfx collection)
	
this package provides a set of bitmapped cyrillic fonts at 75 dots
per inch.  these are unicode (iso10646-1) fonts.
in most cases it is desirable to have the x font server (xfs) and/or
an x server installed to make the fonts available to x clients.

the fonts from this package are not designed for big monitors and/or
large screen resolutions (over 1024x768).  you can find big fonts in
the package xfonts-cronyx-100dpi.

the fonts are modified (mainly with cyrillics added) versions of the
most important x-window fonts from 75dpi/.
