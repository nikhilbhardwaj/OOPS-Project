A+ programming language development environment
	
a+ is a powerful and efficient programming language. it is freely
available under the gnu general public license. it embodies a rich set
of functions and operators, a modern graphical user interface with
many widgets and automatic synchronization of widgets and variables,
asynchronous execution of functions associated with variables and
events, dynamic loading of user compiled subroutines, and many other
features. execution is by a rather efficient interpreter. a+ was
created at morgan stanley. primarily used in a
computationally-intensive business environment, many critical
applications written in a+ have withstood the demands of real world
developers over many years. written in an interpreted language, a+
applications tend to be portable.

this is a metapackage that provides a complete a+ development environment.
the a+ run-time environment is provided by the aplus-fsf package.
