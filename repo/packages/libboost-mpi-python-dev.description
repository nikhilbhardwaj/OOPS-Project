Python interface to the message passing interface (mpi) (default version)
	
this package forms part of the boost c++ libraries collection.

the boost.mpi library provides a c++ interface to mpi that
supports modern c++ development styles, including complete support for
user-defined data types and c++ standard library types, arbitrary function
objects for collective algorithms, and the use of modern c++ library
techniques to maintain maximal efficiency.

this package provides python bindings to the c++ interface.

this package is a dependency package, which depends on debian's default
boost version (currently 1.42).
