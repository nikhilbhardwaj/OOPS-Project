Adaptec i2o hardware raid management utilities
	
suite of programs to manage some i2o-compliant raid controllers; in
particular some adaptec hardware; to be very specific those using the
dpt_i2o kernel module or config_scsi_dpt_i2o driver, or (for more
recent kernels) the i2o_block and i2o_config modules, or
config_i2o_block and config_i2o_config drivers.  one can
create/delete a raid array, add/remove a hot spare drive to/from an
array, activate/silence the alarm, and query array/disk status.
