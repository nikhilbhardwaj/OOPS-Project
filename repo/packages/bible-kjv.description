King james version of the bible: user interface program.
	
this package contains a text-retrieval program and user interface which is
primarily designed to operate on the text and concordance of the king
james translation of the bible, although it could, in principle, be
used for any text.  the search/browse engine allows searching and
reading passages from scripture. includes full concordance.

it would be nice if someone could set up a web interface for the bible.
