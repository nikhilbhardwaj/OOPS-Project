X cursor management library
	
xcursor is a simple library designed to help locate and load cursors for the
x window system.  cursors can be loaded from files or memory and can exist in
several sizes; the library automatically picks the best size.  when using
images loaded from files, xcursor prefers to use the render extension's
createcursor request for rendering cursors.  where the render extension is
not supported, xcursor maps the cursor image to a standard x cursor and uses
the core x protocol createcursor request.
