Perl implementation of a soap client and server
	
soap::lite is a collection of perl modules that provide a simple and
lightweight interface to the simple object access protocol (soap) both on
client and server side.

this version of soap::lite supports a subset of the soap 1.1 specification
and has initial support for soap 1.2 specification.
see http://www.w3.org/tr/soap for details.
