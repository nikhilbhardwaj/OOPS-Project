Xml pull parser library for java
	
xml pull parser (in short xpp) is a streaming pull xml parser for java.
this version xpp3 is a successor of xpp2 (see package libxpp2-java) that
implements xmlpull api (see http://www.xmlpull.org).

however xpp3 currently supports only parsing and does not support
incremental node tree from xpp2.
