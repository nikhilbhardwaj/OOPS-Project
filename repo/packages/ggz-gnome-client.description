Ggz gaming zone: core client for the gnome desktop
	
ggz core clients enable players to access the ggz server to chat, meet
other people in the game lobbies, play with them, watch their scores,
and be spectator other people's games.

the core client for gnome has intentionally been kept simple to use.  it
does however not provide all ggz features.

this package is part of the ggz gaming zone, a multiuser networked
gaming environment.
