A front-end using readline to "cook" input lines for other programs
	
this tool lets you use history and line-editing in any text oriented
tool. this is especially useful with third-party proprietary tools that
cannot be distributed linked against readline. it is not perfect but it
works pretty well.

see the ledit and rlwrap packages for other programs of that kind.
