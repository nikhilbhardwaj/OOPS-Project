The authenticating firewall [ssl library]
	
nufw is an authenticating firewall based on netfilter's nfqueue target.
it allows to write filtering rules based on user identity, in addition
to classical network criteria. unless other solutions, nufw uses a
strict security model and can apply different access rules to users
connected on the same host, for example.

this library provides an abstraction layer over ssl functions.
