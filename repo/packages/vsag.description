Very simple archive generator
	
vsag is a very simple program aimed at generating debian archives out of
a directory filled with packages.

it doesn't track state or manage the directory itself in any way.  its
purpose is to provide a very simple method to generate the files normally
provided by a debian archive so that it can be used by programs like apt
or debootstrap.
