Virtual sticky-notes for your desktop
	
rhinote is a small program that provides virtual sticky-notes. it's handy
for jotting down quick notes or holding copied text that you plan to paste
elsewhere later.

notes can be saved as plain text for later viewing/editing with rhinote or
any other text editor.

rhinote is designed to be "keyboard friendly", that is, every single action
is bound to a specific keystroke.
