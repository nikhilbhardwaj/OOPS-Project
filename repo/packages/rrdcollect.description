Round-robin-database collecting daemon
	
rrdcollect is a daemon which polls certain files in /proc/
directory, gathering data and storing it inside rrdtool's
database files.  being written in c it should be both fast
and resources-friendly.  it supports both scanf(3)-style
pattern matches and perl compatible regular expressions.

this package does not create rrd files. you need to create those files
manually using rrdtool package.
