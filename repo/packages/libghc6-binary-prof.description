Haskell library for binary serialisation; profiling library
	
this package provides a library for the haskell programming language,
compiled for profiling.

binary serialisation of haskell values to and from lazy bytestrings.
the binary library provides methods for encoding haskell values as
streams of bytes directly in memory. the resulting bytestring can
then be written to disk, sent over the network, or futher processed
(for example, compressed with gzip).
