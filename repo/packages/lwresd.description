Lightweight resolver daemon
	
lwresd is the daemon providing name lookup services to clients that use
the bind 9 lightweight resolver library.  it is essentially a stripped-
down, caching-only name server that answers queries using the bind 9
lightweight resolver protocol rather than the dns protocol.
