Make ghostscript fonts available to x11
	
this packages makes the 35 postscript fonts from the gsfonts package
available to your x server under their "urw" names and via
fonts.alias with the official "adobe" names, too.

this package does not contain any fonts itself but allows to reuse
the ghostscript fonts as x11 screen fonts.
