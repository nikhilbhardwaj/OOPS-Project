Python/c++ bindings generator runtime library (debug, transitional package)
	
sip is a tool for generating bindings for c++ classes with some ideas
borrowed from swig, but capable of tighter bindings because of its
specificity towards c++ and python.

this is a transitional package that depends on python-sip-dev.
it can be safely removed.
