Python module for delimiter-separated-value files
	
python-dsv is an alternative to python's standard csv module, with
somewhat different usage and optional support for wxwidgets-mediated
user interaction in the course of format autodetection.  like the
standard module, it supports a wide range of delimiters and handles
both import and export.
