Embed brainf*ck in your perl code
	
brainf*ck (yes, there is a u there.) is about the tiniest turing-complete
programming language you can get.  a language is turing-complete if it can
model the operations of a turing machine--an abstract model of a computer
defined by the british mathematician alan turing in 1936.  a turing machine
consists only of an endless sequence of memory cells and a pointer to one
particular memory cell.  yet it is theoretically capable of performing any
computation.  this module will allow you to mix brainf*ck with your
perl code.
