Ladspa plugin sporting anti-aliased oscillators
	
this plugin contains three anti-aliased oscillators, all based on the
concept of using precomputed bandlimited dirac pulses to construct the
classical waveforms. they are both memory and cpu efficient. the first
one produces a flat spectrum (impulses) and the second generates a
sawtooth waveform. the third one (new in 0.3.0), provides a variable
width rectangular waveform.
