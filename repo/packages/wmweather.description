Windowmaker dockapp that shows your current weather
	
wmweather provides a monitor on a 64x64 mini window that displays the current
weather. the weather reports are received from noaa's national weather
service at http://www.nws.noaa.gov/, that is the same source that pilots use.

wmweather is designed to work with the windowmaker dock, but will work with
other window managers as well. xbase-clients are required for the left click
to bring up the complete metar record.
