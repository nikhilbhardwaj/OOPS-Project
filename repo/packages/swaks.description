Smtp command-line test tool
	
swaks (swiss army knife smtp) is a command-line tool written in perl
for testing smtp setups; it supports starttls and smtp auth (plain,
login, cram-md5, spa, and digest-md5). swaks allows to stop the smtp
dialog at any stage, e.g to check rcpt to: without actually sending a
mail.

if you are spending too much time iterating "telnet foo.example 25"
swaks is for you.
