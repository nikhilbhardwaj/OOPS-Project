Gnu r package for delayed-data
	
g.data creates and maintains delayed-data packages (ddp's). data
stored in a ddp are available on demand, but do not take up memory
until requested.  you attach a ddp with g.data.attach(), then read from
it and assign to it in a manner similar to s-plus, except that you must
run g.data.save() to actually commit to disk.
