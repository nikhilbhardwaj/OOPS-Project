Spawn external processes in conkeror
	
this helper tool named conkeror-spawn-helper is necessary to let the
conkeror web browser spawn external process, e.g. to edit form fields
in an external program. it was previously named spawn-process-helper.

maybe helpful for other xulrunner based applications, too.
