Universal steganographic tool
	
outguess is a universal steganographic tool that allows the insertion of
hidden information into the redundant bits of data sources. the nature of the
data source is irrelevant to the core of outguess. the program relies on data
specific handlers that will extract redundant bits and write them back after
modification. in this version the pnm and jpeg image formats are supported.
