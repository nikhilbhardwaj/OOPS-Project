Expression language for java-based applications - javadoc
	
mvel may be useful as an extension to anything from use in jsp tag libraries,
to the configuration facilities of your library/framework.

in addition to being an expression language, mvel also comes packaged with an
templating system similar to velocity and freemarker.

this package provides the api documentation for libmvel-java.
