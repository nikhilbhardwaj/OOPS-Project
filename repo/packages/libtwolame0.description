Mpeg audio layer 2 encoding library
	
twolame is an optimized mpeg audio layer 2 encoder. it is based on toolame by
mike cheng, which in turn is based upon the iso dist10 code and portions of
lame.

twolame does not support mpeg audio layer 3 (mp3) encoding due to patent
issues surrounding mp3.

however, as most mpeg audio players are able to play layer 2 (mp2) files,
twolame makes a very good drop-in replacement for lame and other layer 3
encoders.

this package contains the shared library.
