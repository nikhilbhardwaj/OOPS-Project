Program launcher for idle x sessions
	
xautolock monitors input devices under the x window system, and launches a
program of your choice if there is no activity after a user-configurable
period of time.  you can use this to automatically start up a screen locker
if you have left your computer unattended for some period of time.  the
program launched need not be a screen locker such as xlock.
