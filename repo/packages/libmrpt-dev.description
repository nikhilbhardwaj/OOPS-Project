Mobile robot programming toolkit - development headers
	
the mobile robot programming toolkit (mrpt) is an extensive, cross-platform,
and open source c++ library aimed to help robotics researchers to design and
implement algorithms in the fields of simultaneous localization and mapping
(slam), computer vision, and motion planning (obstacle avoidance).

this package provides the mrpt headers and libraries for development.
