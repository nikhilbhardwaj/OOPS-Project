Text-based audio cd player and cd-rom control commands
	
cdtool contains cdplay, cdeject, cdstop, cdpause, and several other
programs for playing audio cds and controlling a cd-rom drive from
the command line and in a quick and scriptable way.

cdown reads track info and queries a cddb database for info on
the current cd. cdctrl is a command line utility for controlling a
cd-rom drive interactively and from scripts. cdir keeps track of the
contents of different cds using a workman-compatible database.
