Dri configuration applet
	
driconf is a configuration applet for the direct rendering infrastructure
(dri). it allows customizing performance and visual quality settings of opengl
drivers on a per-driver, per-screen and/or per-application level.

driconf is implemented in python. it uses the gtk+ toolkit bindings and the
xdriinfo program (from the xdriinfo or xbase-clients package) to retrieve
configuration information from opengl drivers.
