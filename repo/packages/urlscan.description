Extract and browse the urls contained in an email (urlview replacement)
	
urlscan searches for urls in email messages, then displays a list of
them in the current terminal.  it is primarily meant as a replacement
for urlview, which it improves upon in the following ways:


 * urlscan understands email encodings such as quoted-printable;
   urlview does not.
 * urlscan extracts and displays the context surrounding each url.
