Cd input and control library
	
this is a interface to the gnu cd input and control library (libcdio)
and it's iso 9660 library (libiso9660) which are written in c. the
library encapsulates cd-rom reading and control and iso 9660
handling. perl programs wishing to be oblivious of the os- and
device-dependent properties of a cd-rom can use this library.
