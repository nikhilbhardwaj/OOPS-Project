Notificator for incoming mail
	
the newmail program usually puts itself in the background and watches
mailbox files in order to report when new mail has been arrived.  the
originator and subject will then be reported on the terminal it was
started.  the output can also be integrated in graphical programs.

this package is inspired by the newmail program from the elm mail system.
