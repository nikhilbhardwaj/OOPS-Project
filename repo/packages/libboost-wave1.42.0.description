C99/c++ preprocessor library
	
this package forms part of the boost c++ libraries collection.

the wave c++ preprocessor library is a standards conformant
implementation of the mandated c99/c++ preprocessor functionality
packed behind a simple to use interface, which integrates well with
the well known idioms of the standard template library (stl).
