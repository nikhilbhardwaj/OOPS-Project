Lower quality, small music files for frozen-bubble
	
frozen-bubble is a clone of the popular "puzzle bobble" game, featuring
100 single-player levels and a two-player mode.

this package contains low-quality music for frozen bubble. the 8-bit
samples used don't sound as good as the 16-bit ones in fb-music-high,
but are about half the size.
