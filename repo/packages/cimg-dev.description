Powerful image processing library
	
the cimg library is a c++ toolkit providing simple classes and functions
to load, save, process and display images in your own c++ code. it consists
only of a single header file cimg.h that must be included in your program
source. it contains useful image processing algorithms for loading/saving,
resizing/rotating, filtering, object drawing (text, lines, faces,
ellipses, ...), etc.

images are instantiated by a class able to represent images up to 4-dimension
wide (from 1-d scalar signals to 3-d volumes of vector-valued pixels), with
template pixel types. it depends on a minimal number of libraries : you can
compile it with only standard c libraries. no need for exotic libraries and
complex dependencies.
