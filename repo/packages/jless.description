A file pager program, similar to more(1) supporting iso2022
	
jless is a program similar to more (1), but which allows backward
movement in the file as well as forward movement.  also, jless does not
have to read the entire input file before starting, so with large input
files it starts up faster than text editors like vi (1).  jless uses
terminfo, so it can run on a variety of terminals.  there is even limited
support for hardcopy terminals.

jless supported iso 2022 code extension techniques and japanese codes.
