Pluggable authentication module for samba
	
this is a module for pam that enables a system administrator to migrate
user passwords from the unix password database to the smb password
database as used by samba, and to subsequently keep the two databases in
sync.  unlike other solutions, it does this without needing users to log
in to samba using cleartext passwords, or requiring them to change their
existing passwords.
