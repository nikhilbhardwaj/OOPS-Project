Simple perl object base class
	
rose::class is a generic base class for classes. it provides a single class
method (error), but may be expanded further in the future.

a class that inherits from rose::class is not expected to allow objects
of that class to be instantiated, since the namespace for class and object
methods is shared. for example, it is common for rose::object-derived classes
to have error methods, but this would conflict with the rose::class method of
the same name.
