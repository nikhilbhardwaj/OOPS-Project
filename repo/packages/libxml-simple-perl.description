Perl module for reading and writing xml
	
the xml::simple module provides a simple api layer on top of an underlying
xml parsing module to maintain xml files (especially configuration
files).  two functions are exported: xmlin() and xmlout().

the simplest approach is to call these two functions directly, but an
optional object oriented interface allows them to be called as
methods of an xml::simple object.  the object interface can also be
used at either end of a sax pipeline.
