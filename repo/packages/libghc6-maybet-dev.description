Haskell maybet monad transformer - ghc 6 libraries
	
maybet is a haskell monad transformer that adds maybe semantics to an
existing monad, making it able to fail (i.e. return nothing) or be
successful (return the result wrapped in a just).

if you don't know what a haskell monad is, you can just ignore this package.

this package contains the libraries compiled for ghc 6.
