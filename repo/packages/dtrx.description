Intelligently extract multiple archive types
	
dtrx is basically the same as tar -zxf or tar -xjf except you don't have
to remember the flags for each file. but there's more to it than that.
you know those really annoying files that don't put everything in a
dedicated directory, and have the permissions all wrong? dtrx takes care
of all those problems for you, too. dtrx is simple and powerful. just
use the same command for all your archive files, and they'll never
frustrate you again.
