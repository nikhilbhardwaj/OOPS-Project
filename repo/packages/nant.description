Build tool similar to ant
	
nant is different than make.  instead of a model where it is extended with
shell-based commands, nant is extended using task classes.  instead of
writing shell commands, the configuration files are xml-based, calling
out a target tree where various tasks get executed.  each task is run
by an object that implements a particular task interface.

nant supports different target frameworks:

 - microsoft .net framework version 1.0, 1.1 and 2.0
 - mono 1.0 and 2.0
