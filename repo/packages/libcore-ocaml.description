Jane street's standard library for ocaml (runtime)
	
core is an alternative to the ocaml standard library developed by
jane street capital.

core does a number of things:


 * provides tail recursive versions of non tail recursive functions in
   the standard library;
 * changes the signature of many of the standard modules to enforce
   consistent naming conventions;
 * includes generic serialization for most types;
 * adds some new modules as well as new functionality to existing
   modules.


beware that core extends some functionality of the legacy standard
library, and outright changes or replaces other; backward compatibility

the code of core is routinely reviewed within jane street capital
according to their quality assurance requirements. the extra library
called core_extended adds new functionalities on top of core, but is
only reviewed on an ad-hoc basis.

this package contains the runtime stuff you need to run programs using
core (but not core_extended).
