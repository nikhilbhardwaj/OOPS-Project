Displays a graphic of your disk usage with du
	
xdiskusage is a user-friendly program to show you what is using up
all your disk space. it is based on the design of the "xdu" program
written by phillip c. dykstra. changes have been made so it runs "du"
for you, and can display the free space left on the disk, and produce
a postscript version of the display.
