Software modem with iax2 connectivity
	
iaxmodem is a software modem written in c that uses an iax channel (commonly
provided by an asterisk pbx system) instead of a traditional phone line and
uses a dsp library instead of dsp hardware chipsets.

iaxmodem was originally conceived to function as a fax modem usable with
hylafax, and it does that well. however iaxmodem also has been known to
function with mgetty+sendfax and efax.
