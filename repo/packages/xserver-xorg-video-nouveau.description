X.org x server -- nouveau display driver (experimental)
	
this driver for the x.org x server (see xserver-xorg for a further description)
provides support for nvidia riva, tnt, geforce, and quadro cards.

although the nouveau project aims to provide full 3d support it is not yet
complete, and these packages do not include any 3d support.
users requiring 3d support should use the non-free "nvidia" driver.

this package is built from the freedesktop.org xf86-video-nouveau driver.
