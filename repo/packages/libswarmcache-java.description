Simple, yet powerful distributed caching mechanism for java
	
swarmcache is a simple but effective distributed cache. it uses ip
multicast to efficiently communicate with any number of hosts on a lan.
it is specifically designed for use by clustered, database-driven web
applications. such applications typically have many more read
operations than write operations, which allows swarmcache to deliver
the greatest performance gains. swarmcache uses javagroups internally
to manage the membership and communications of its distributed cache.
