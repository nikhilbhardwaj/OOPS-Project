Minimal debian build daemon - builder
	
mini-buildd is an easy-to-configure debian autobuilder and
repository. its general notion is that of add-ons for a debian
base distribution (like etch, lenny, or sid) with an emphasis
on clean builds and package checking.

this package equips a machine to act as a builder for a specific
architecture. before builders can be set up a repository host
must be fully configured (see the package mini-buildd-rep).
