Binding to the gio
	
this package provides a library for the haskell programming language.
see http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on haskell.

gio is striving to provide a modern, easy-to-use vfs api that sits at the
right level in the library stack. the goal is to overcome the shortcomings of
gnomevfs and provide an api that is so good that developers prefer it over raw
posix calls. among other things that means using gobject. it also means not
cloning the posix api, but providing higher-level, document-centric
interfaces.
