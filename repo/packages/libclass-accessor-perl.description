Perl module that automatically generates accessors
	
class::accessor automagically generates accessor/mutator methods for your
class. most of the time, writing accessors is an exercise in cutting and
pasting. if you make your module a subclass of class::accessor and declare
your accessor fields with mk_accessors() then you will find yourself with a
set of automatically generated accessors which can even be customized.
