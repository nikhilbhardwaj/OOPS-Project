A specialized markup language for representing png contents
	
sng (scriptable network graphics) is a minilanguage designed
specifically to represent the entire contents of a png (portable
network graphics) file in an editable form. thus, sngs representing
elaborate graphics images and ancillary chunk data can be readily
generated or modified using only text tools.

sng is implemented by a compiler/decompiler called sng that
losslessly translates between sng and png.
