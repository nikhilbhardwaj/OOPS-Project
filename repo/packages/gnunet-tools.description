gnunet is a peer-to-peer framework which focuses on providing security. all
link-to-link messages in the network are confidential and authenticated. the
framework provides a transport abstraction layer and can currently encapsulate
the peer-to-peer traffic in udp, tcp, or smtp messages.

this package contains additional tools such as the gnunet-setup graphical tool.
