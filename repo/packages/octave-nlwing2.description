Nonlinear lifting line for wings in octave
	
this package allows efficient computation of nonlinear aerodynamic
properties of a wing in octave, a scientific computing software. it
employs 2d section data to build a 3d potential vortex model of the
flow. it uses a robust euler-newton method to track the change of
flow vorticity quantities as the angle of attack progresses.

this octave add-on package is part of the octave-forge project.
