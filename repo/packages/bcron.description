Bruce's cron system (programs)
	
this is bcron, a new cron system designed with secure operations in mind.
to do this, the system is divided into several separate programs, each
responsible for a separate task, with strictly controlled communications
between them.  the user interface is a drop-in replacement for similar
systems (such as vixie-cron), but the internals differ greatly.

this package contains the bcron programs.
