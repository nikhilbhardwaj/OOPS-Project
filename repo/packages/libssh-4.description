the ssh library was designed to be used by programmers needing a working ssh
implementation by the mean of a library. the complete control of the client
is made by the programmer. with libssh, you can remotely execute programs,
transfer files, use a secure and transparent tunnel for your remote programs.
with its sftp implementation, you can play with remote files easily.
