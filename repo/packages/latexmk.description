Perl script for running latex the correct number of times
	
latexmk runs latex the correct number of times to resolve cross references,
etc; it also runs auxiliary programs (bibtex, makeindex if necessary, and
dvips and/or a previewer as requested). it has a number of other useful
capabilities, for example to start a previewer and then run latex whenever the
source files are updated, so that the previewer gives an up-to-date view of
the document.
