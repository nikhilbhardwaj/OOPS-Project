Rogue, the classic dungeon exploration game
	
this is a text-based game common on (traditional) bsd systems.  it may
not be distributed freely, so it had to be broken off from the main
bsdgames package and placed in non-free.

this package now contains only rogue, the classic dungeon exploration game.
