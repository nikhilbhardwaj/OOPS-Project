Generate similarity hashes to find nearly duplicate files
	
one of the questions that it's nice to be able to answer about a pair of files
is the degree of similarity between them. this command-line tool is useful for
estimating the "degree of similarity" between a pair of nominally sequential
files such as textfiles. the tool uses manassas's "shingleprinting" technique.
