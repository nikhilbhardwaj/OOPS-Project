Service delivery suite framework - kannel sms gateway api
	
netsds::kannel module provides api to kannel sms gateway.

to decrease innecessary problems we use a lot of predefined parameters
while sending and receiving messages via kannel http api. it's not so
flexible as direct http processing but less expensive in development
time ;-)

this modules uses lwp to send messages and cgi.pm to process messages
from kannel.
