Abstract document tree for perl pod documents
	
pod::abstract provides an abstract, tree-based interface to pod documents. it
allows straightforward, round-trip capable manipulation of pod documentation.

this also allows an easy tree-based mechanism to write a pod::<format> type
filter. the package includes a simple, and extensible, command line utility
called "paf" (pod::abstract filter). this program can chain together filter
operations, allowing manipulation and extraction of pod documents from the
command line.
