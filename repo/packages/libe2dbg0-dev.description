The embedded elf debugger library
	
the embedded elf debugger is the implementation of a new concept of
debugger that run inside the process to be debugged instead of being
an external entity accessing from the outside the target address space.
instead of using system-specific api such as ptrace, the debugger is
linked into a library that is getting injected in a process using the
ld_preload environment variable. this makes e2dbg very efficient as it
does not need context switching for inspecting the target process.
the eresi debugger can also be scripted in the same conditions as a
complete eresi interpreter is embedded into the debugger.

this package contains the development files provided by elfsh (the
static library - i.e the .a file - and the elfsh headers).
