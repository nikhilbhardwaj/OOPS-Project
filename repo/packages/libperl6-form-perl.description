Perl - perl6::form - implements the perl 6 'form' built-in
	
formats are perl 5's mechanism for creating text templates with
fixed-width fields. those fields are then filled in using values from
prespecified package variables.

unlike perl 5, perl 6 doesn't have a c<format> keyword. or the
associated built-in formatting mechanism. instead it has a form.pm
module. and a c<form> function.
