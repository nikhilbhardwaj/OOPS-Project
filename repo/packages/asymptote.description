Script-based vector graphics language inspired by metapost
	
asymptote is a powerful script-based vector graphics language for technical
drawings, inspired by metapost but with an improved c++-like syntax.
asymptote provides for figures the same high-quality level of typesetting that
latex does for scientific text.
