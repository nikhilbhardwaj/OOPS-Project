Renice running processes based on regular expressions
	
reniced takes a list of regular expressions, looks for processes
matching them and renices the processes to given values.

instead of editing the scripts in /etc/init.d to give daemons the
nicelevel you want (and get prompted at every package update because
these files are conffiles) you can just run reniced once a day.
