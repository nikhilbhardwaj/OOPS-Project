Cyrus sasl extension for php 5
	
sasl is the simple authentication and security layer (as defined by
rfc 2222).  it provides a system for adding plugable authenticating
support to connection-based protocols.  the sasl extension for php
makes the cyrus sasl library functions available to php. it aims to
provide a 1-to-1 wrapper around the sasl library to provide the
greatest amount of implementation flexibility.  to that end, it is
possible to build both a client-side and server-side sasl
implementation entirely in php.
