Device firmware update (dfu 1.0) usb programmer
	
dfu-util is a program that implements the host (pc) side of the usb dfu 1.0
(universal serial bus device firmware upgrade) protocol.

note: at this point only dfu version 1.0 is supported!

in the openmoko project (for example), this program is used to communicate
with the specially enhanced bootloader u-boot, which implements the dfu
device side.
