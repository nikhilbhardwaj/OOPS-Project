Add replay gain volume tags to ogg vorbis files
	
vorbisgain calculates a percieved volume of an ogg vorbis file using
the replay gain algorithm. it then stores a per-track and per-album
volume adjustment in the file's tags, to let songs play back  with a
uniform volume. the process is non-destructive and does not change the
audio data at all.

many audio players in debian support reading these tags, including xmms,
quod libet, amarok, muine, and rhythmbox.
