Java class file shrinker, optimizer, and obfuscator
	
proguard is a free java class file shrinker, optimizer, and
obfuscator.  it can detect and remove unused classes, fields,
methods, and attributes. it can then optimize bytecode and remove
unused instructions. finally, it can rename the remaining classes,
fields, and methods using short meaningless names. the resulting jars
are smaller and harder to reverse-engineer.
