Unit testing framework for objective caml
	
ounit is a unit testing framework for objective caml, imspired
by the junit tool for java and the hunit tool for haskell.

ounit is designed to provide a convenient way for you to write tests
for your ocaml code.  tests can be aggregated into test suites, making
it easy to both write tests close to the code being examined and
execute a comprehensive aggregate set of tests -- or any subset of it.
