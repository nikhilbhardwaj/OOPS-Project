Gap computer algebra system, compiler and development files
	
gap is a system for computational discrete algebra with particular
emphasis on computational group theory, but which has already proved
useful also in other areas.   in the example text, gap is used to
analyse rubik's cube using group theory.  a kernel implements a pascal-like
language.

this package contains the gap compiler and the headers files and
objects files necessary to build gap packages.

the gap compiler (gac) creates c code from gap code and then calls
the system's c compiler to produce machine code from it. this can
result in a speedup.
