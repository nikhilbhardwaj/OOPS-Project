Perl module to use ssi from cgi scripts
	
cgi::ssi is meant to be used as an easy way to filter shtml through cgi
scripts in a loose imitation of apache's mod_include. if you're using
apache, you may want to use either mod_include or the apache::ssi module
instead of cgi::ssi. limitations in a cgi script's knowledge of how the
server behaves make some ssi directives impossible to imitate from a cgi
script.
