Tools for compiling prayer templates
	
prayer is yet another webmail interface.

it is unusual in that it is a complete, standalone, http server and proxy
rather a apache/mod_php plugin. prayer maintains persistent connections to
the imap server and is written entirely in c. consequently it is much
faster than most open source webmail interfaces and puts very little load
on either the machines running the web server or the backend imap servers
(even if traditional unix format mailfolders are in use).

prayer uses its own macro expansion language for the html it
outputs. this package contains the programs and scripts needed to
build template libraries, as well as a makefile to facilitate the
process.
