Pre-calculate binding of ligands to their receptor
	
the autodocksuite addresses the molecular analysis of the docking of
a smaller chemical compounds to their receptors of known three-dimensional
structure.

the autogrid program performs pre-calculations for the docking of a
ligand to a set of grids that describe the effect that the protein has
on point charges.  the effect of these forces on the ligand is then
analysed by the autodock program.
