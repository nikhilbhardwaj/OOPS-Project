Development files and documentation for the lasi library
	
lasi is a library that provides a c++ stream output interface (with
operator <<) for creating postscript documents that can contain
characters from any of the scripts and symbol blocks supported in
unicode and by the pango layout engine. the library accommodates
right-to-left scripts such as arabic and hebrew as easily as
left-to-right scripts. indic and indic-derived complex text layout
(ctl) scripts, such as devanagari, thai, lao, and tibetan are
supported to the extent provided by pango and by the opentype fonts
installed on your system. all of this is provided without need for
any special configuration or layout calculation on the programmer's
part.

this package contains the development files as well as the html
documentation for lasi.
