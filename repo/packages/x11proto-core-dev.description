X11 core wire protocol and auxiliary headers
	
this package provides development headers describing the wire protocol
for the core x11 protocol, and also provides a number of utility headers,
used to abstract os-specific functions.

this package deprecates 'x-dev', a package from the monolithic builds of
xfree86 and x.org.

this package is built from the x.org xproto proto module.
