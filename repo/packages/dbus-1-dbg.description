Simple interprocess messaging system (debug symbols)
	
d-bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and corba in
terms of complexity.

this package provides support for debugging programs that use the core
d-bus shared library.

see the dbus package description for more information about d-bus in general.
