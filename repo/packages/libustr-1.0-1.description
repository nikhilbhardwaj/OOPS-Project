Micro string library: shared library
	
ustr (micro string library) is a string api for c. it has tiny overhead over
just plain strdup(), is much safer, is easier to use, is faster for many
operations, can be used with read-only or automatically allocated data. you
don't even need to link to the library to use it (so there are no
dependencies).

this package contains the shared library for ustr.
