Tunnel tcp connections over icmp packets
	
ptunnel is an application that allows you to reliably tunnel tcp
connections to a remote host using icmp echo request and reply
packets, commonly known as ping requests and replies. it acts as
a proxy and can handle sockets and secured identification.

those features can be very handy when working in a closed networking
environment with firewalls and proxies.
