Perl interface to online jifty applications
	
jifty is a full-stack web framework. it provides an optional rest
interface for applications. using this module, you can interact with
that rest interface to write client-side utilities.

you can use this module directly, but you'll be better off subclassing
it, such as is done in net::hiveminder.

this module also provides a number of convenient methods for writing
short scripts.
