Manipulates nucleotide sequence alignments in bam or sam format
	
the bam library provides i/o and various operations on manipulating nucleotide
sequence alignments in the bam (binary alignment/mapping) or sam (sequence
alignment/map) format. it now supports importing from or exporting to sam,
sorting, merging, generating pileup, and quickly retrieval of reads overlapped
with a specified region.
