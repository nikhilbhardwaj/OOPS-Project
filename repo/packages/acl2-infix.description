A computational logic for applicative common lisp: infix interface
	
acl2 is both a programming language in which you can model computer
systems and a tool to help you prove properties of those models.

this package contains utilities and libraries to access acl2 via an
infix notation similar to that used in many non-lisp programming
languages.
