Haskell bindings to the terminfo library; profiling libraries
	
this package provides a library for the haskell programming language,
compiled for profiling.
see http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on haskell.

this library provides an interface to the terminfo database (via bindings to
the curses library). terminfo allows posix systems to interact with a variety
of terminals using a standard set of capabilities.
