Gnu scientific library (gsl) -- development package
	
the gnu scientific library (gsl) is a collection of routines for
numerical analysis.  the routines are written from scratch by the gsl
team in c, and present a modern api for c programmers, while allowing
wrappers to be written for very high level languages.

this package contains the header files, static libraries and symbolic
links that developers using gnu gsl will need.
