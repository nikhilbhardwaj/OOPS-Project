Alternative jvm for openjdk, using cacao
	
the package provides an alternative runtime using the cacao vm and the
cacao just in time compiler (jit).  this is a somewhat faster alternative
than the zero port on architectures like alpha, armel, m68k, mips, mipsel,
powerpc and s390.

the vm is started with the option `-cacao'. see the readme.debian for details.
