Ntfs-3g filesystem in userspace (fuse) library headers
	
the ntfs-3g driver is an open source, gpl licensed, third generation linux
ntfs driver which was implemented by the linux-ntfs project. it provides
full read-write access to ntfs, excluding access to encrypted files, writing
compressed files, changing file ownership, access right.

technically it's based on and a major improvement to the third generation
linux ntfs driver, ntfsmount. the improvements includes functionality,
quality and performance enhancements.

ntfs-3g is based on fuse (userspace filesystem framework for linux), thus
you will have to prepare fuse kernel module to be able to use it.

fuse is available in any recent kernel. no need to prepare a kernel module
if you are already running debian etch kernel or newer.

this package contains the library headers for developing programs using
libntfs-3g75.
