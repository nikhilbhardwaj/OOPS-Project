Module for looking up information about modules
	
module::load::conditional provides simple ways to query and possibly load any
of the modules you have installed on your system during runtime. it is able
to load multiple modules at once or none at all if one of them was not able
to load. it also takes care of any error checking and so forth.

please note that this module is considered deprecated upstream, so it may not
receive future support and may be removed from debian.
