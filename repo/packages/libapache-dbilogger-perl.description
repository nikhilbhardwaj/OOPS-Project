Tracks what's being transferred in a dbi database
	
this module tracks what's being transfered by the apache web server
in a sql database (everything with a dbi/dbd driver).  this allows to
get statistics (of almost everything) without having to parse the log
files (like the apache::traffic module, just in a "real" database,
and with a lot more logged information).
