Frontend to many compression programs
	
comprez, aka 'z', is a simple, safe and convenient front-end for the
compress(1), uncompress(1), gzip(1), bzip2(1), tar(1), zip(1) and
unzip(1) utilities for compressing and uncompressing files and
directories.

the basic idea is that you can just run "comprez something" where
something is any file, directory, compressed file or compressed
archive, and program will do the right thing in a standard way.
simple for novices and convenient for experts.
