Vi improved - common gui files
	
vim is an almost compatible version of the unix editor vi.

many new features have been added: multi level undo, syntax
highlighting, command line history, on-line help, filename
completion, block operations, folding, unicode support, etc.

this package contains files shared by all gui-enabled vim
variants available in debian.  examples of such shared files are:
gvimtutor, icons, desktop environments settings, and menu entries.
