Extensible contact-form application for django
	
this is a reusable application which simplifies including a contact form within
django, the python web framework.  out of the box it provides a basic contact
form which, once appropriate templates have been written, will email site
administrators when the form is submitted.

the form and view used are designed to be extensible to allow for easy
adaptation to more complex needs.  it also features built-in integration with
the akismet web service, to simplify spam filtering.
