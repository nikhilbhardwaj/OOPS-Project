Source for the sysprof module
	
sysprof is a sampling cpu profiler that uses a linux kernel module to profile
the entire system, not just a single application. sysprof handles shared
libraries and applications do not need to be recompiled. in fact they don't
even have to be restarted.

this package contains the source for the sysprof's kernel module.

you need a linux kernel version 2.6.11 or newer on an i386 or amd64
processor.
