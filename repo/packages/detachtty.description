Attach/detach from interactive processes across the network
	
detachtty lets you run interactive programs non-interactively, and
connect to them over the network when you do need to interact with
them.  it's designed for long-running lisp processes.  unlike screen,
it works in emacs comint modes, and unlike qcmu, it deals correctly
with passing on a sigint sent to it.  needs ssh for operation over the net.
