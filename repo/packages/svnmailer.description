Extensible subversion commit notification tool
	
the svnmailer is a tool, which is usually called by a subversion hook
to submit commit notifications in various ways (at the moment: mail via
smtp or a pipe to a sendmail like program, news via nntp, cia live
tracker notification via xml-rpc). it is derived from the original
mailer.py distributed with subversion, but supposed to be much more
consistent, better extensible and to have much more features. have a
look at the documentation for further details.
