75 dpi unicode cyrillic fonts for x (cronyx collection)
	
this package provides a set of bitmapped cyrillic fonts at 75 dots
per inch.  these are unicode (iso10646-1) fonts and support all
current slavic cyrillic letters as well as some russian
prerevolutionary letters.  in most cases it is desirable to have the
x font server (xfs) and/or an x server installed to make the fonts
available to x clients.

this package and xfonts-cronyx-100dpi provide the same set of
fonts, rendered at different resolutions; only one or the other is
necessary, but both may be installed.  xfonts-cronyx-75dpi may be
more suitable for small monitors and/or small screen resolutions
(under 1024x768).

the upstream source of this package is the package xcyr of serge
winitzki.  xcyr is a descendant of the package xrus-2.3 of andrey
chernov.
