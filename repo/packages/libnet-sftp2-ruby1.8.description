Ruby implementation of the sftp protocol
	
net::sftp is a pure-ruby implementation of the sftp protocol (specifically,
versions 1 through 6 of the sftp protocol). note that this is the "secure file
transfer protocol", typically run over an ssh connection, and has nothing to
do with the ftp protocol.
