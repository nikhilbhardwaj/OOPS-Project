Nonlinear equations and nonlinear least squares static library
	
minpack includes software for solving nonlinear equations and
nonlinear least squares problems.  five algorithmic paths each include
a core subroutine and an easy-to-use driver.  the algorithms proceed
either from an analytic specification of the jacobian matrix or
directly from the problem functions.  the paths include facilities for
systems of equations with a banded jacobian matrix, for least squares
problems with a large amount of data, and for checking the consistency
of the jacobian matrix with the functions.

this package provides the headers, man pages, examples, and static library.
