Wxwidgets cross-platform c++ gui toolkit (gtk+ development)
	
wxwidgets (formerly known as wxwindows) is a class library for c++ providing
gui components and other facilities on several popular platforms (and some
unpopular ones as well).  for more information see http://wxwidgets.org

this package provides files needed to compile wxwidgets programs.  if you
want to compile apps using the (optional) glcanvas library you will need
to have mesa or opengl installed too.
