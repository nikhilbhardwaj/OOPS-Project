A command line midi player for alsa
	
alsa is an effort to create a modules sound system for linux,
while maintaining full compatibility with oss/lite.

this program works with latest alsa 1.0 drivers and former 0.9 versions.

this is a straightforward command line program to play midi files
through the alsa sequencer.

as you can specify the client and port to connect to on the command
line it is also useful for testing alsa or clients that need to receive
sequencer events.
