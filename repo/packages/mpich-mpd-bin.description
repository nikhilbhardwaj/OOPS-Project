Mpi parallel computing system implementation, mpd version
	
mpich is a robust and flexible implementation of the mpi (message passing
interface).  mpi is often used with parallel or distributed computing
projects.  mpich is a multi-platform, configurable system (development,
execution, libraries, etc) for mpi.  it can achieve parallelism using
networked machines or using multitasking on a single machine.

this version is compiled with ch_p4mpd support, which requires mpd daemons
running on each of the cluster nodes.  this method is faster than ch_p4.
