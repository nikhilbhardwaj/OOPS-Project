A real-time visual space simulation
	
celestia is a free 3d astronomy program. based on the hipparcos
catalogue, it allows users to display objects ranging in scale from
artificial satellites to entire galaxies in three dimensions using
opengl. unlike most planetarium software, the user is free to travel
about the universe.

this is a dummy package that selects at least one frontend for celestia.
