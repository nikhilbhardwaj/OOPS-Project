Gnome frontend for fax programs
	
the gfax project aims to provide a free front end to the various facsimile
programs available for linux and other operating systems that use the gnome
project.
this is a gnome-2.x port of gfax and is written in c# using mono and gtk#.

gfax provides the familiar "pop up" window and phone book support when one
"prints" to a "fax" printer.
