Sugar graphical shell - emulator
	
sugar is a graphical user interface aimed at children.

originating as intregral part of the olpc "xo" a.k.a. the $100 laptop,
sugar has since grown into a more widely usable low-ressource desktop
environment for kids.

this package contains a wrapper script to run sugar in a xephyr window,
making it possible to run it from inside another desktop environment.
