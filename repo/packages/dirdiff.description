Display and merge changes between two directory trees
	
dirdiff can handle up to 5 trees.  it displays a main window with a
list of the files which are different between the trees, with colored
squares to indicate the relative ages of the versions.  a menu allows
you to display the differences between any two of the versions in
another window.  another menu allows you to copy the file from one
tree to another.
