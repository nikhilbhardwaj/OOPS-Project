The eresi standard library
	
libstderesi is a collection of 100+ builtin commands shared between many
eresi components. it was unmerged from librevm which is now only holding
the eresi language interpreter.

this package contains the development files provided by libstderesi (the
static library - i.e the .a file - and the libstderesi headers).
