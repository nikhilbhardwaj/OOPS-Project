Module for validating forms with simple chains of constraints
	
formvalidator::simple provides you a sweet way of form data validation with
simple constraints chains. you can write constraints on single line for each
input data.

this idea is based on sledge::plugin::validator, and most of
validation code is borrowed from this plugin.
