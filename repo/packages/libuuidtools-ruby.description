Uuids generation library for ruby
	
uuidtools was designed to be a simple library for generating any
of the various types of uuids (or guids if you prefer to call
them that). it conforms to rfc 4122 whenever possible.

this is a dependency package, which depends on a uuidtools package
built for the current default version of ruby.
