Perl module to add xpath support to html::treebuilder
	
html::treebuilder::xpath is a drop-in replacement for html::treebuilder (see
libhtml-treebuilder-perl) that adds typical xpath methods, making it easy to
query a document and extract information about nodes and values.

it is also capable of generating two representations of the xml output: a
compact version, intended for machine readable output and minimal space
requirements (in terms of disk space and network bandwidth); and a human
readable, indented version.
