Libast2 development files
	
headers, static libraries and documentation for developing software
that uses libast2.

libast is the library of assorted spiffy things.  it contains many
spiffy things, and it is a library.  thus, the ever-so-creative name.
libast has been previously known as libmej, the eterm helper library
which nobody really understood and certainly never used.  the
plan is to gradually remove some of the neat stuff from eterm that
could be made generic (things like the theme parsing engine, the
command-line options parser, perhaps the event engine, ...) and place
it here in the hopes that others will find them useful.
