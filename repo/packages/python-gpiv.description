Wrapper of libgpiv
	
this module allows the functionality of libgpiv3 in python scripts
to develop programs for particle image velocimetry (piv). in this way
you can extend the functionality of the piv processing as provided by
the programs of the gpivtools package and by gpiv. an example
script is provided in usr/docs, including a double-frame image for
cross-correlation that can be interrogated by the script.
