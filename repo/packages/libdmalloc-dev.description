Debug memory allocation library (development files and doc)
	
drop in replacement for the system's `malloc', `realloc', `calloc', `free' and
other memory management routines while providing powerful debugging facilities
configurable at runtime.

these facilities include such things as memory-leak tracking, fence-post write
detection, file/line number reporting, and general logging of statistics.

this package contains the static libraries and documentation.
