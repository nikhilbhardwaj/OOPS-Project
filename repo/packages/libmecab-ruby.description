Mecab binding for ruby language (dependency package)
	
mecab is a morphological analysis system.  it reads japanese
sentences from the standard input, segments them into morpheme
sequences, and outputs them to the standard output with many
additional pieces of information (pronunciation, semantic
information, etc).

this is a dependency package which depends on debian's default ruby version
(currently 1.8.x).
