Minimalist gnu win32 (cross) binutils
	
a linux hosted, win32 target, cross compiler for c/c++

freedom through obsolescence.  those who still really need to
can now build windows executables from the comfort of debian.

this package contains the toolchain binutils.  it is separate
only for build reasons, you'll need all the mingw* packages
to actually build anything.
