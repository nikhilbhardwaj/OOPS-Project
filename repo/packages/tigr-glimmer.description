Gene detection in archea and bacteria
	
developed by the tigr institute this software detects coding sequences in
bacteria and archea.

glimmer is a system for finding genes in microbial dna, especially the
genomes of bacteria and archaea. glimmer (gene locator and interpolated
markov modeler) uses interpolated markov models (imms) to identify the
coding regions and distinguish them from noncoding dna.
