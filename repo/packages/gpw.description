Trigraph password generator
	
this package generates pronounceable passwords. it uses the statistics of
three-letter combinations (trigraphs) taken from whatever dictionaries you
feed it.

thus pronounceability may differ from language to language. based
on the ideas in morrie gasser's password generator for multics, and dan
edwards's generator for ctss.  fips standard 181 describes a similar
digraph-based generator, derived from gasser's.
