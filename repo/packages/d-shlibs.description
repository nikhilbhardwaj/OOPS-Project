Debian shared library package building helper scripts
	
shared library packages in debian need some special catering to do
with regards to which files go where. this package contains
programs which try to help automate the process and catch simple
errors

"d-shlibmove" moves the shared library binary around from temporary
installation directory to the  destination package directory

"d-devlibdeps" tries to list the development library dependencies
required for using the -dev package.
