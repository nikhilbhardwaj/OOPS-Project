Quote strings for passing through the shell
	
this perl module contains some functions which are useful for quoting
strings which are going to pass through the shell or a shell-like
object, plus a command-line interface to it.  it is useful for doing
robust tool programming, particularly when dealing with files whose
names contain white space or shell globbing characters.
