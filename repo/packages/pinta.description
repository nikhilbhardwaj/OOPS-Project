A simple gtk+ drawing/painting program
	
pinta is a drawing/editing program modeled on paint.net. its goal is to
provide a simplified alternative to the gimp for casual users.

features include:

 - adjustments (auto level, black and white, sepia, …)
 - multiple layers
 - unlimited undo/redo
 - drawing tools (paintbrush, pencil, shapes, …)


pinta is currently early in development, and should be treated as such.
