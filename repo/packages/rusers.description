Displays who is logged in to machines on local network
	
the rusers command produces output similar to who, but for the list of hosts
or all machines on the local network.  for each host responding to the rusers
query, the hostname with the names of the users currently logged on is printed
on each line.  the rusers command will wait for one minute to catch late
responders.
