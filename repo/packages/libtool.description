Generic library support script
	
this is gnu libtool, a generic library support script.  libtool hides
the complexity of generating special library types (such as shared
libraries) behind a consistent interface.  to use libtool, add the
new generic library building commands to your makefile, makefile.in,
or makefile.am.  see the documentation for details.  libtool supports
building static libraries on all platforms.

libtool supports generation of c, c++, fortran and java libraries.
