Utilities for single-host parallel shell scripting
	
the middleman system (mdm) is a set of utilities that help you
parallelize your shell scripts.  simply label the commands to run in
parallel, and the system automatically exploits every parallelization
opportunity that arises at runtime.  you can also specify dependency
between commands so that they run in an appropriate order.

comes with an ncurses-based monitoring console.  compatible with xargs,
find, make, any shell, together, in a script or interactively.
