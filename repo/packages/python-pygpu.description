Embedded language for programming gpu using python
	
pygpu is a compiler that lets you write image processing programs in
python that execute on the graphics processing unit (gpu) present in
modern graphics cards. this enables image processing algorithms to
take advantage of the performance of the gpu. in some applications,
performance increases approach an order of magnitude, compared to cpus.
