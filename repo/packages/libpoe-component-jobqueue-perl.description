Poe component to manage queues and worker pools
	
poe::component::jobqueue manages a finite pool of worker sessions as they
handle an arbitrarily large number of tasks. it often is used as a form of
flow control, preventing a large group of tasks from exhausting some sort of
resource.

this module implements two kinds of queue: active and passive. both types of
queues use a worker coderef to spawn sessions that process jobs, but how they
use the worker differs between them.
