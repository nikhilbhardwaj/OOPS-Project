A command line drag-and-drop tool for gnome
	
dragbox is a tool for connecting the command line with
the desktop environment. it summons a drag handle in a
window when you are managing files or text in the shell,
connecting the different workspaces -- desktop and
command line.

dragbox can take items on the command line or from a
pipe and put on its shelf. the inverse is also possible:
dragged-to items can be output to the shell.
