Program for collection and display of time-series data
	
this is cricket. it is a configuration, polling, and data-display engine
wrapped around the rrd tool by tobias oetiker. there are three user-visible
pieces to cricket: the collector, the grapher, and the config tree. the
collector runs from cron and fetches data from a number of devices
according to the info it finds in the config tree. the grapher is a cgi
application that allows users to traverse the config tree from a web
browser and see the data that the collector recorded.
