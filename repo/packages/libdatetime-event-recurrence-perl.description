Perl module to create recurring datetime instances
	
datetime::event::recurrence provides a way to create sets of datetime objects
the recur at specified intervals. often, you will want datetime::set objects
for dates that should occur at intervals like "once a month" or "every day."

more complex relationships can be created too, such as, "every monday,
wednesday and thursday at 10:00 am and 2:00 pm."
