Script telnetable connections
	
net::telnet allows you to make client connections to a tcp port and
do network i/o, especially to a port using the telnet protocol.
simple i/o methods such as print, get, and getline are provided.
more sophisticated interactive features are provided because
connecting to a telnet port ultimately means communicating with a
program designed for human interaction.  these interactive features
include the ability to specify a timeout and to wait for patterns to
appear in the input stream, such as the prompt from a shell.
