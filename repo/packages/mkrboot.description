Make a kernel + root image bootable from one disk or from dos
	
mkrboot generates boot disks that contain both a kernel and a root image.
this enables debian bootup for installation purposes from one floppy.

mkrboot can also use loadlin to make a floppyless installation possible.

boot methods supported:

 - loadlin from running dos/windows without a floppy
 - loadlin from a freedos bootup disk
 - lilo from one floppy
 - kernel boot loader from one floppy
 - syslinux from one floppy
