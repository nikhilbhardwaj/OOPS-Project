Double-double and quad double types in c++ and f90
	
this package supports both a double-double datatype (approx. 32
decimal digits) and a quad-double datatype (approx. 64 decimal
digits). the computational library is written in c++. both c++ and
fortran-90 high-level language interfaces are provided to permit one
to convert an existing c++ or fortran-90 program to use the library
with only minor changes to the source code.
