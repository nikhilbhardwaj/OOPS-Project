A keylogger for gnu/linux systems
	
logkeys is no more advanced than other available linux keyloggers, but is a
bit more up to date, it doesn't unreliably repeat keys and it should never
crash your x.  all in all, it just seems to work.  it relies on event
interface of the linux input subsystem.  once set, it logs all common
character and function keys, while also being fully aware of shift and
altgr key modifiers.
