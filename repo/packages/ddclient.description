Address updating utility for dynamic dns services
	
this package provides a client to update dynamic ip addresses with
several dynamic dns service providers, such as dyndns.com.

this makes it possible to use a fixed hostname (such as
myhost.dyndns.org) to access a machine with a dynamic ip address.

this client supports both dynamic and (near) static services, as  well as
mx record and alternative name management. it caches the address, and
only attempts the update when it has changed.
