General graphics interface terminfo display target
	
"general graphics interface" - a fast, portable graphics environment.

this package contains the driver for the "terminfo" target, enabling
libggi (and therefore any program using libggi) to display its
output in text mode.  this target does not support graphics; it only
makes text modes available.  (however, you can display graphics on a
text-mode target using the "monotext" target.)  output is displayed in
a terminal-independent fashion using the "ncurses" library.
