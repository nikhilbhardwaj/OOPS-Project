Statistical analysis tool
	
pspp is a program for statistical analysis of sampled data. it
interprets commands in the spss language and produces tabular output
in ascii, postscript, or html format.

pspp development is ongoing. it already supports a large subset of
spss's transformation language.  its statistical procedure support is
currently limited, but growing.
