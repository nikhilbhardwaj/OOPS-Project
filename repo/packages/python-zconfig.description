Structured configuration library
	
zconfig is a configuration library intended for general use.  it
supports a hierarchical schema-driven configuration model that allows
a schema to specify data conversion routines written in python.
zconfig's model is very different from the model supported by the
configparser module found in python's standard library, and is more
suitable to configuration-intensive applications.
