Library for multi-way secret-sharing (headers)
	
this library implements shamir's method for secret sharing, which can be
used to split a secret (like a gpg secret key) into multiple parts, so that
at least some number of those parts are needed to recover the original file,
but any smaller combination of parts is useless to an attacker.

this package contains header files and static libraries, needed to compile
programs that use libgfshare.
