Perl module to format text tables
	
text::formattable renders simple tables as text. you pass to the constructor
(new) a table format specification similar to latex (e.g. r|l|l) and you
call methods to fill the table data and insert rules. after the data is filled,
you call the render method and the table gets formatted as text.
