Perl module to accelerate the perl parsing interface (ppi)
	
ppi::xs provides xs-based acceleration of the core ppi packages. it
selectively replaces a (small but growing) number of methods throughout ppi
with identical but much faster c versions.

once installed, it will be auto-detected and loaded in by ppi completely
transparently. the integration between the primary (perl) implementation and
the xs-accelerated version are designed to degrade gracefully if they fall out
of sync -- the perl version is preferred over the xs version.
