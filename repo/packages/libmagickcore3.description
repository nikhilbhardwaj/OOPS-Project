Low-level image manipulation library
	
the magickcore api is a low-level interface between the c programming language
and the imagemagick image processing libraries and is recommended for
wizard-level programmers only. unlike the magickwand c api which uses only a
few opaque types and accessors, with magickcore you almost exlusively access
the structure members directly.

this package contains the c libraries needed to run executables that make
use of magickcore.
