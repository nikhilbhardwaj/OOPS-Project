Easy-to-use self-cleaning scratch space
	
when writing test suites for modules that operate on files,
it's often inconvenient to correctly create a platform-independent
temporary storage space, manipulate files inside it, then clean it
up when the test exits. the inconvenience usually results in tests
that don't work everywhere, or worse, no tests at all.

directory::scratch aims to eliminate that problem by making it easy to
do things right.
