pcb is an interactive printed circuit board editor for the x11 window
system. pcb includes a rats nest feature, design rule checking, and can
provide industry standard rs-274-x (gerber), nc drill, and centroid data
(x-y data) output for use in the board fabrication and assembly process.
pcb offers high end features such as an autorouter and trace optimizer
which can tremendously reduce layout time.
