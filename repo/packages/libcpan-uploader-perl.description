Module to upload packages to the cpan
	
cpan::uploader is a perl module which allows developers to upload their
modules and packages to the comprehensive perl archive network (cpan) via
the [perl programming] authors upload server (more commonly known as pause).

it provides a direct programmatic interface via a singleton class, but also
includes a command-line utility called `cpan-upload' to do the same.
