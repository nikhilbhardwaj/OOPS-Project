Sync mail dir gnome applet
	
sync mail dir is a set of utilities to synchronize a pair of mail boxes
in maildir format, using ssh to transfer data.

this package provides an applet that integrates smd-loop with gnome, i.e.
notifies the user with popups, starts smd-loop when the user logs in and
provides a simple user interface to deal with synchronization errors.
