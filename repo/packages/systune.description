Kernel tuning through the /proc file system
	
this program writes kernel parameters, previously saved in a configuration
file, to the /proc filesystem.  this enables kernel performance to be
adjusted without recompiling the kernel.

systune can be alternative to sysctl(8). it is also started after the most
daemons and other init.d scripts, so it can be used as "second stage" sysctl.
