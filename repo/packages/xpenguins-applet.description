Gnome2 panel applet implementation of xpenguins
	
this program is a gnome2 panel applet that animates a friendly family
of penguins in your root window.  they drop in from the top of the
screen, walk along the tops of your windows, up the side of your
windows, levitate, skateboard, and do other similarly exciting
things. xpenguins is now themeable so if you're bored of penguins, try
something else. the basic themes are provided by the xpenguins package
(this is the xpenguins-applet package), so you'll have to install that
before xpenguins-applet will work.
