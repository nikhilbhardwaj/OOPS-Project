Test framework for tcp client libraries using poe
	
test::poe::server::tcp is a perl object environment (poe, see libpoe-perl)
component that provides a tcp server framework for inclusion in your client
module's test cases. once registered, a session will receive events related
to client connections, disconnections, input and any flushed output. it will
also get a unique client identifier which may be used in communication with
the client component when sending data to the client or ending a connection.
