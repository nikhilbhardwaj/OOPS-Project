Development files for the libcxgb3 driver
	
libcxgb3 is a device-specific driver for chelsio t3-based iwarp (rdma
over ip/ethernet) adapters for the libibverbs library.  this allows
userspace processes to access chelsio iwarp hardware directly with
low latency and low overhead.

this package contains static versions of libcxgb3 that may be linked
directly to an application, which may be useful for debugging.
