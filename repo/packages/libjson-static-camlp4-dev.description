Json validator and converter for ocaml
	
json-static is a tool for converting parsed json data
with an unchecked structure into specialized ocaml
types and vice-versa.

by reading a type definition, the preprocessor inserts
code that converts between ocaml types and untyped
json data.

type definitions are written in a syntax which is
very close to regular ocaml type definitions.
