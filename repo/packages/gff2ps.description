Produces postscript graphical output from gff-files
	
gff2ps is a script program developed with the aim of converting gff-formatted
records into high quality one-dimensional plots in postscript. such plots
maybe useful for comparing genomic structures and to visualizing outputs from
genome annotation programs.
it can be used in a very simple way, because it assumes that the gff file
itself carries enough formatting information, but it also allows through a
number of options and/or a configuration file, for a great degree of
customization.
