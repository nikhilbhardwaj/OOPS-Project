msrp is a data and metadata search and replacement tool.  it easily
changes filenames and file contents for all listed command line arguments
recursively.  it can help you to rename your symbols in your favorite
programming languages, and help you avoid renaming all your files by hand
each time you decide to change a function, variable, or class name.  it
