Output template data in a test-friendly format
	
html::template::dumper helps you to test html::template-based programs by
printing only the information used to fill-in the template data. this makes
it much easier to automatically parse the output of your program. currently,
data can be outputed by data::dumper (default) or yaml.

note that the underlying html::template methods are still called, so options
like strict and die_on_bad_params will still throw errors.
