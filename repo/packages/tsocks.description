Transparent network access through a socks 4 or 5 proxy
	
tsocks provides transparent network access through a socks version 4
or 5 proxy (usually on a firewall). tsocks intercepts the calls
applications make to establish tcp connections and transparently
proxies them as necessary. this allows existing applications to use
socks without recompilation or modification.
