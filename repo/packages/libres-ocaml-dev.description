Ocaml library for automatically resizing contiguous data structure
	
this ocaml library consists of a set of modules which implement
automatically resizing (i.e. reallocating) data structures that consume
a contiguous part of memory.

this allows appending and removing of elements to/from arrays (both
boxed and unboxed), strings (i.e. buffers), bit strings and weak arrays
while still maintaining fast constant-time access to elements.

there are also functors that allow the generation of similar modules
which use different reallocation strategies.
