Utility that controls a process and its descendants
	
pslist is a simple utility to list the process ids (pids) of a process and
all its children, and its children's children, and so on.  if invoked with
a command name which ends in 'kill', it sends a signal to a selected group
of processes.  if invoked with a command name which ends in 'renice',
it sets the nice level of the selected group of processes.
