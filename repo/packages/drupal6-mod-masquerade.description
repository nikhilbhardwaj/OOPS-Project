the masquerade module is designed as a tool for site designers and
site administrators. it allows a user with the right permissions to
switch users. while masquerading, a field is set on the $user object,
and a menu item appears allowing the user to switch back. watchdog
entries are made any time a user masquerades or stops masquerading.
