Grand unified bootloader (legacy version)
	
grub is a gpled bootloader intended to unify bootloading across x86
operating systems.  in addition to loading the linux kernel,
it implements the multiboot standard, which allows for flexible loading
of multiple boot images (needed for modular kernels such as the gnu hurd).

please note that grub legacy is in maintanance mode and new features are
only accepted in grub 2 (grub-pc package).
