A graphical display of directories referenced at the shell prompt
	
viewglob complements the unix shell by presenting a graphical display
showing the contents of directories referenced on the command line,
including the current directory.  the display also shows results of file
globs and expansions as they are typed, with selected files and possible
name completions highlighted.

viewglob currently supports bash and zsh.  it should work with any
x-based terminal emulator (xterm, gnome-terminal, konsole, etc.).
