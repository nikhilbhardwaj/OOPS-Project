Dynamic host information system - sendmail mx engine
	
this package contains a mail relaying service module to be used
with dhisd release 5 or above and the dynamic dns module.

while the dhis server dhisd retrieves dynamic ip addresses
from clients, this module allows the server to deliver messages
that were previously queued for the newly online host.
