flpsed is a wysiwyg pseudo postscript editor. "pseudo", because you can't
remove or modify existing elements of a document. but flpsed lets you add
arbitrary text lines to existing postscript 1 documents. added lines can
later be reedited with flpsed. using pdftops, which is part of xpdf one can
convert pdf documents to postscript and also add text to them. flpsed is
useful for filling in forms, adding notes etc.
