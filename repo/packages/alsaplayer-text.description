Pcm player designed for alsa (text version)
	
alsaplayer is a pcm player designed specifically for use with alsa, but
works great with oss or esound.  it's heavily threaded which cuts down on
skipping, offers optional and even simultaneous visual scopes, plays
mp3, mp2, ogg, cdda, audiofs, and lots more.

this package provides a text interface to alsaplayer, and does not require x
or gtk+ to run.
