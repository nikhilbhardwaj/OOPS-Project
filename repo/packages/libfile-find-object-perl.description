Object oriented file::find replacement
	
file::find::object does same job as file::find but works like an object and
with an iterator. as file::find is not object oriented, one can't perform
multiple searches in the same application. the second problem of file::find
is its file processing: after starting its main loop, one can't easily wait
for another event and so get the next result.
