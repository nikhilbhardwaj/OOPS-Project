Apache http server - high speed threaded model
	
each apache multi-processing module provides a different "flavor" of
web server binary, compiled with a different processing model.

the worker mpm provides the default threaded implementation. it is
recommended especially for high-traffic sites because it is faster
and has a smaller memory footprint than the traditional prefork mpm.
