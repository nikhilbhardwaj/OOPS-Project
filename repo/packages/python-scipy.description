Scientific tools for python
	
scipy supplements the popular numpy module (python-numpy package), gathering a
variety of high level science and engineering modules together as a single
package.

scipy is a set of open source scientific and numeric tools for python. it
currently supports special functions, integration, ordinary differential
equation (ode) solvers, gradient optimization, genetic algorithms, parallel
programming tools, an expression-to-c++ compiler for fast execution, and
others.
