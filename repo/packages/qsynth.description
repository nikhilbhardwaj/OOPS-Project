Fluidsynth midi sound synthesiser front-end
	
qsynth is a fluidsynth gui front-end application written in c++ around the qt 4
toolkit. eventually it may evolve into a softsynth management application
allowing the user to control and manage a variety of command line softsynths
but for the moment it wraps fluidsynth (http://www.fluidsynth.org).

fluidsynth is a command line software synthesiser based on the soundfont
specification.
