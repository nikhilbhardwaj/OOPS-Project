qemu is a fast processor emulator: currently the package supports
arm, cris, i386, m68k (coldfire), microblaze, mips, powerpc, sh4,
sparc and x86-64 emulation. by using dynamic translation it achieves
reasonable speed while being easy to port on new host cpus.

this package provides header files and static libraries suitable to
emulate the various cpu supported by qemu directly in an application.
