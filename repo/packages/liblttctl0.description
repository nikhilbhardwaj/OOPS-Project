A library to communicate with the lttng control module
	
the lttng project aims at providing highly efficient tracing tools for linux.
its tracers help tracking down performance issues and debugging problems
involving multiple concurrent processes and threads. tracing across multiple
systems is also possible.

ltt-control is the part of the lttng that allows a machine to be traced.

this library allows applications to communicate with the kernel tracer control
module.
