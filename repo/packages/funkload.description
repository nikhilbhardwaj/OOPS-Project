Web testing tool
	
this web testing tool is designed to allow testing the functionality
and performance of web applications in the same spirit as perl's
www::mechanize. the tool supports recording clicks through a website,
saving them into a python class which you can later modify, and
playing them back later. this allows you to script your web
applications. 'funkload' also supports performance and load testing
your applications.
