The reverse engineering vector machine
	
librevm is a compact library that includes the eresi interpreter. revm
is a central piece of software in the eresi framework as it exports a
complete api for interpreting programs written in the eresi language
independently of the binary format, architecture, or operating system
environment.

the main features of the revm library are :


 * a complete interpreter of the eresi language (foreach, match, gotos,
   arithmetics ..)
 * generation of graphviz input files from control flow graphs (cfg) and
   call graphs of analyzed binary programs, using the analysis api of the
   eresi component libmjollnir.
 * full resolved disassembling of sections, functions, or basic blocks,
   using features from the eresi disassembly engine libasm.
 * a configuration system allowing user variables, for personalizing the
   revm behavior for your own convenience.
 * a generic api of eresi commands to manage prompt, workspaces, and
   terminal colors.
 * a generic module system for dynamically loaded eresi extensions.
 * handling of i/o for receiving commands from readline or from the
   network (optional).
 * capability of logging work sessions on disk for future consultation.


this package contains the development files provided by librevm (the
static library - i.e the .a file - and the librevm headers).
