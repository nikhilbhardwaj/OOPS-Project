Mirrors a whole filesystem tree from one charset to another
	
convmvfs is a fuse (file system in userspace) utility that transparently
mirrors a filesystem tree converting the filenames from one charset to another
on the fly. only the names of files and directories are converted; the file
content remains intact. the mirrored tree is mounted at a given mountpoint.
