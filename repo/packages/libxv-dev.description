X11 video extension library (development headers)
	
libxv provides an x window system client interface to the xvideo
extension to the x protocol.

the xvideo extension allows for accelerated drawing of videos.  hardware
adaptors are exposed to clients, which may draw in a number of colourspaces,
including yuv.

this package contains the development headers for the library found in
libxv1.  non-developers likely have little use for this package.
