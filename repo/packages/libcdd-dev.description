Library for finding vertices of convex polytopes, development
	
the cddlib library is a c library for manipulating general convex
polyhedra.  it supports converting between the system of linear
inequalities representation and a vertices and extreme rays
representation of a polyhedron, and also supports solving linear
programming problems.

this package contains the cddlib development files.
