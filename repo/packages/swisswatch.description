Swiss railway clock for the x window system
	
swisswatch is a clock for the x desktop.  it relies heavily on resources for
configuration, and can be adjusted to a wide range of looks.  while it can be
configured completely via resources and provides looks for a botta (sfmoma)
clock style, an oclock emulation and other appearances, it defaults to the
style of a swiss railway clock.
