Helper routines to access native code from java
	
the package presents a solution completely written in java to access
native code.  features:

 * java side declaration, no c compiler
 * clean design
 * transparent, easy deployment
 * platform independent
 * fast

the effort relies on a combination of upstream's custom design for
the call interface, memory abstraction and data structures and the
basic native binding provided by any third party (currently jna).
