Erlang/otp application for automated testing
	
common test is a portable application for automated testing. it is
suitable for black-box testing of target systems of any type (i.e.
not necessarily implemented in erlang), as well as for white-box
testing of erlang/otp programs. black-box testing is performed via
standard interfaces (such as snmp, http, corba, telnet, etc) and,
if required, via user specific interfaces (often called test ports).
white-box testing of erlang/otp programs is easily accomplished by
calling the target api functions directly from the test case functions.
common test also integrates usage of the otp cover tool for code
coverage analysis of erlang/otp programs.
