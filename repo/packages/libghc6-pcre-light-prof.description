the pcre library is a set of functions that implement regular expression
pattern matching using the same syntax and semantics as perl 5.  the library
aims to be light, efficient and portable.

this package provides a library for the haskell programming language, compiled
for profiling.  see http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on haskell.
