Perl module for merging hierarchies using the c3 algorithm
	
the algorithm::c3 module implements the c3 algorithm.

c3 is the name of an algorithm which aims to provide a sane method resolution
order under multiple inheritence. it was first introduced in the langauge
dylan, and then later adopted as the preferred mro (method resolution order)
for the new-style classes in python 2.3. most recently it has been adopted as
the 'canonical' mro for perl 6 classes, and the default mro for parrot
objects as well.
