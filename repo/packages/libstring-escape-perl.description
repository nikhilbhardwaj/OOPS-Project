Module for manipulating escaped strings
	
string::escape is a perl module that provides a flexible calling interface to
some useful string conversion functions, including applying and expanding the
standard c/unix-style backslash escapes like \n and \t, wrapping and removing
double quotes, and truncating to fit within a desired length.
