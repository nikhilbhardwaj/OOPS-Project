Infinote-based collaborative editing (gtk widgets)
	
libinfinity is library to build collaborative text editors.  changes
to the text buffers are synced to all other clients over a central server.
even though a central server is involved, the local user sees his changes
applied instantly and the merging is done on the individual clients.

this package contains gtk widgets for use in libinfinity-based and
gtk-based applications.
