Vi improved - enhanced vi editor
	
vim is an almost compatible version of the unix editor vi.

many new features have been added: multi level undo, syntax
highlighting, command line history, on-line help, filename
completion, block operations, folding, unicode support, etc.

this package contains a version of vim compiled with a rather
standard set of features.  this package does not provide a gui
version of vim.  see the other vim-* packages if you need more
(or less).
