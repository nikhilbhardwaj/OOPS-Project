Gnu r package for discrete data models
	
this package consists of r functions developed at the political
science computational laboratory at stanford university; it currently
includes models for count data (hurdle regression and zero-inflated
negative binomial and poisson models), ordinal probit and logit (also
available in mass via polr), and an item-response theory model.  also
included are vuong tests for non-nested hypothesis testing and
convenience functions for handling roll-call vote matrices.
