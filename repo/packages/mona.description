A theorem prover based on automata
	
mona is a tool that translates formulas in the logics ws1s or ws2s
into finite-state automata represented by bdds.  the formulas may
express search patterns, temporal properties of reactive systems,
parse tree constraints, etc.  mona also analyses the automaton
resulting from the compilation, and determines whether the formula is
valid and, if the formula is not valid, generates a counter-example.

documentation is available from the mona website http://www.brics.dk/mona/.
