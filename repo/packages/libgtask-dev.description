Gobject library for asynchronous programming - development files
	
gtask is asynchronous and callback based execution for gobject, similar
to python twisted.

unlike twisted, however, gtask will work hard towards being multi-core
ready.

this package contains the headers and development libraries needed to
build applications using the gtask library
