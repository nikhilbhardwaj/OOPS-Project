The lovely sister database (email rolodex) for emacs
	
lsdb (the lovely sister database) is a rolodex-like database program
for semi based mua.  it's intended to be a lightweight relacement for
bbdb (the insidious big brother database).  unfortunately, it
currently doesn't support the all features of bbdb.
