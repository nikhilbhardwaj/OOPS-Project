Perl module to wrap subroutines in packages
	
sub::wrappackages is a perl module that can add pre- and post-execution code
wrappers around some given subroutines. it is mostly a wrapper around damian
conwway's hook::lexwrap module. instead of exporting a wrap function, magic
happens when you load the module via the "use" keyword.
