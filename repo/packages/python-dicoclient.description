Rfc 2229 compliant dictionary client module and shell
	
gnu dico is an implementation of the dict protocol as defined in rfc 2229.
it is fully modular: the daemon itself (dicod) provides only the server
functionality, and knows nothing about database formats. actual searches
are performed by functions supplied in loadable modules. a single module
can serve one or more databases.

this package contains a python module that provides a dico client and a simple
interactive shell.
