Distributed, peer-to-peer replicated database system
	
prophet is a lightweight schemaless database designed for peer to peer
replication and disconnected operation. prophet keeps a full copy of
your data (and history) on your laptop, desktop or server. prophet syncs
when you want it to, so you can use prophet-backed applications whether
or not you have network.

if you're not a programmer, you likely want an end-user application
built on top of prophet, rather than this package.
