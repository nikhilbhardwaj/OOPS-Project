Theme engine using qt 4 for gtk+ 2.x
	
the gtk-qt theme engine (also known as gtk-qt-engine) is a gtk+ 2 theme engine
that calls qt 4 to do the actual drawing. this makes your gtk+ 2 applications
look almost like real qt 4 applications and gives you a more unified desktop
experience.

this style can be configured within kde4's systemsettings using package
system-config-gtk-kde .
