Dynamic access of native libraries from java without jni (documentation)
	
jna provides java programs easy access to native shared libraries without
writing anything but java code - no jni or native code is required. this
functionality is comparable to windows' platform/invoke and python's ctypes.
access is dynamic at runtime without code generation.

this package contains the javadoc api documentation.
