Gnome bindings for the lua language version 5.1
	
this package contains the lua bindings for the gnome libraries, including
gtk, gdk, glib, pango, atk, libxml2, cairo, clutter,
gtksourceview, gio, gnet, gtkglext, gtkspell and gconf.

the api is almost identical to the c api, but in an object oriented fashion.
the library takes care of memory management, which makes it much easier to
use.
