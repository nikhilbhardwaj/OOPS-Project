Memory analysis tool for python
	
meliae is a library meant to help people understand how their memory is being
used in python.

this project is similar to heapy (in the 'guppy' project), in its attempt to
understand how memory has been allocated.

currently, its main difference is that it splits the task of computing
summary statistics of memory consumption from the actual scanning of memory
consumption.
