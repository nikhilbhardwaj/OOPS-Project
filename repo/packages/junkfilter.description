A junk-email filtering program for procmail
	
this package uses procmail filtering algorithms to detect junk email. this
results in internal procmail variables being assigned to indicate the reason
why the email has been classified as junk. the user can then use those
variables within their .procmailrc file to deal with the junk in any way
they see fit. there are a number of filters available in the package, and
can be selected from a simple config file on a per-user basis.
