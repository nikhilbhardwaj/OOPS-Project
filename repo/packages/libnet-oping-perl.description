Module for icmp latency measurement
	
net::oping is a perl module for sending icmp echo_requests (better known as
"ping packets") and measuring the time that elapses until the reception of an
icmp echo_reply packet (also known as "pong"). it supports pinging multiple
hosts in parallel using ipv4 or ipv6 transparently.
