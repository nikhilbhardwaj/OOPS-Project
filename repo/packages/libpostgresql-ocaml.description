Ocaml bindings to postgresql's libpq (runtime)
	
this ocaml-library provides an interface to postgresql, an
efficient and reliable, open source, relational database.
almost all functionality available through the c-api (libpq) is
replicated in a type-safe way. this library uses objects for
representing database connections and results of queries.

this package contains the shared runtime stub libraries and plugins.
