Cross-platform package builder by easy software products
	
this package allows a developer to produce packages for several
different platforms from a single specification.  currently, debian
dpkg, rpm, at&t/solaris pkg, hp-ux depot/swinstall, and irix
inst/tardist packages are supported, as well as a "portable" package
that includes installation and removal scripts and a gui setup
program.
