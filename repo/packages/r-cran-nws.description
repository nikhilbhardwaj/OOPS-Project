Gnu r package for distributed programming via networkspaces
	
this debian package provides support for networkspaces (nws), a distributed
computing toolkit which makes  it easy to use computing clusters from within
the python and gnu r languages and scripting environments..

see http://www.ddj.com/web-development/200001971 for a recent overview
article on networkspaces (albeit with a focus on use from python).
