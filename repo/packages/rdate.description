Sets the system's date from a remote host
	
rdate displays and sets the local date and time from the host name
or address given as the argument. the time source may be an rfc 868
tcp protocol server, which is usually implemented as a built-in
service of inetd(8), or an rfc 2030 protocol sntp/ntp server. by
default, rdate uses the rfc 868 tcp protocol.
