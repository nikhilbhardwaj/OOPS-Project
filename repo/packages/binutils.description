The gnu assembler, linker and binary utilities
	
the programs in this package are used to assemble, link and manipulate
binary and object files.  they may be used in conjunction with a compiler
and various libraries to build programs.

on some architectures the (experimental) gnu gold linker is included.
it currently fails to link some applications and libraries (i.e. won't
link usable kernels).
