Development webserver for cakephp applications
	
cakephp is a flexible model-view-controller rapid application development
framework for php inspired by ruby on rails.

this package contains a tiny python-based webserver suitable for quick
development of cakephp applications, similar to django's 'runserver' and
the 'script/server' script in ruby on rails.
