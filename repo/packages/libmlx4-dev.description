Development files for the libmlx4 driver
	
libmlx4 is a device-specific driver for mellanox connectx infiniband
host channel adapters (hcas) for the libibverbs library.  this allows
userspace processes to access mellanox hca hardware directly with
low latency and low overhead.

this package contains static versions of libmlx4 that may be linked
directly to an application, which may be useful for debugging.
