Bidirectional support for icedove
	
an extension for icedove (originally written for thunderbird) that allows
users to create emails with explicit paragraph directionality, as needed for
proper recipient rendering of emails with bidi languages, such as hebrew,
arabic, farsi, urdu or yiddish.

the extension adds "bidi" controls, setting the paragraph direction, as well
as automatic direction sensing for unformatted text messages, and direction
overrides.
