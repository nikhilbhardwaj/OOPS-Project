File upload capability to your servlets and web applications
	
the commons fileupload package makes it easy to add robust, high-performance,
file upload capability to your servlets and web applications.

fileupload parses http requests which conform to rfc 1867, "form-based file
upload in html". that is, if an http request is submitted using the post
method, and with a content type of "multipart/form-data", then fileupload
can parse that request, and make the results available in a manner easily
used by the caller.
