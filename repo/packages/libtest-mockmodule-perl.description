Perl module to override subroutines in a module for unit testing
	
test::mockmodule lets you temporarily redefine subroutines in other
packages for the purposes of unit testing.

a test::mockmodule object is set up to mock subroutines for a given
module. the object remembers the original subroutine so it can be
easily restored. this happens automatically when all mockmodule
objects for the given module go out of scope, or when you unmock()
the subroutine.
