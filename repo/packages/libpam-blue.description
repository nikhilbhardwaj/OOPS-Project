Pam module for local authenticaction with bluetooth devices
	
pam_blue is a dynamically loadable binary object for the pam security
framework in linux. it is presented as an extension for the common pam
modules, gives the user the ability for authenticate via a
bluetooth-compatible device like a cell phone or other bluetooth
dongles (e.g. epox-presenter). due to the fact that a whole part of
the bluetooth stack is implemented in hardware-side it is relatively
difficult to change the bluetooth hardware mac address which makes
this module more secure.
