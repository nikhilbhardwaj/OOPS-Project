Perl module for creating xml-dom and oo based cgi scripts
	
this module provides an xml-dom and object-oriented extension to the
cgi module.  the xml-dom extension allows one to generate the output
from xml and laid out according to an xslt stylesheet, separating
code and presentation.  the object-oriented extension allows one to
specify handlers for events like a mouse click on a submit button or
on an image.
