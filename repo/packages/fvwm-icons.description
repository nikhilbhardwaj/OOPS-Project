Icon *.xpm files from fvwm development site
	
this package contains small icons for use with window manager menus.
the icons include generic symbols (balls, books, hexagons) and descriptive
icons for programs (file manager, netscape logo etc.). note, that these
icons are quite basic and do not include any shadow effects.

originally the icons were for fvwm which is a small memory footprint
icccm2 compliant multiple virtual desktop window manager.
