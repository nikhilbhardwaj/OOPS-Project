Small, unconfigurable window manager
	
wm2 is a window manager for x.  it provides an unusual style of window
decoration and as little functionality as chris cannam feels comfortable
with in a window manager.  wm2 is not configurable, except by editing
the source and recompiling the code, and is really intended for people
who don't particularly want their window manager to be too friendly.
