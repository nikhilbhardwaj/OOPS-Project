High-performance asynchronous http client library headers
	
serf library is a c-based http client library built upon the apache
portable runtime (apr) library.  it multiplexes connections, running the
read/write communication asynchronously.  memory copies and
transformations are kept to a minimum to provide high performance
operation.

this package contains development headers for serf.
