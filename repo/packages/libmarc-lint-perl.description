Perl extension for checking validity of marc records
	
marc::lint is a perl module for checking the validity of marc records. most
of the users will want to do something like is shown in the synopsis. other
users may choose instead to overload marc::lint's methods and provide their
own special field-level checking. if you have certain requirements, such as
making sure that all 952 tags have a certain call number in them, you can
write a function that checks for that, and still get all the benefits of the
marc::lint framework.
