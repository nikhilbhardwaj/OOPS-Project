Olpc xo power management support daemon
	
the powerd daemon can function as an easily customizable replacement for ohmd
(independent of x, dbus, and hald).  this package provides the powerd
and olpc-switchd daemons, and related utilities.  the olpc-switchd daemon
simply provides notifications about lid and switch events.  the powerd daemon
controls display dimming, automatically putting an xo to sleep after a period
of idleness, etc.
