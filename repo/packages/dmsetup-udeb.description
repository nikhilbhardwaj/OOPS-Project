The linux kernel device mapper userspace library
	
the linux kernel device mapper is the lvm (linux logical volume management)
team's implementation of a minimalistic kernel-space driver that handles
volume management, while keeping knowledge of the underlying device layout
in user-space.  this makes it useful for not only lvm, but evms, software
raid, and other drivers that create "virtual" block devices.

this package contains a utility for modifying device mappings.
