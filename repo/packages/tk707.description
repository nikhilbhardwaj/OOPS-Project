Drum sequencer for a sound card or midi device
	
this program emulates the operation of roland's tr-707 rhythm
composer.

the output is to a midi device, sound card or file.  a
latin-percussion instrument map emulates the roland tr-727 and
the instrument map can be customized by the user. if you do not
have a midi sound card, you should install the timidity package
to emulate one..
