Binaries for the  libdap data access protocol library
	
10opendap provides software that allows you to access data over the internet,
from programs that weren't originally designed for that purpose, as well
as some that were. while opendap is the original developer of the data access
protocol which its software uses, many other groups have adopted dap
and provide compatible clients, servers and software development kits.

this package contains the 'getdap' client binary.
