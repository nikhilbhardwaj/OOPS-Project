Manage stacks of patches in a git repository
	
stgit provides similar functionality to quilt
(i.e. pushing/popping patches to/from a stack) on top of git.

these operations are performed using git commands and the patches
are stored as git commit objects, allowing easy merging of the stgit
patches into other repositories using standard git functionality.
