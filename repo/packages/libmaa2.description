The maa programming library
	
the libmaa library provides many low-level data structures which are
helpful for writing compilers, including hash tables, sets, lists,
debugging support, and memory management.  although libmaa was designed
and implemented as a foundation for the kheperalong, the data structures
are generally applicable to a wide range of programming problems.

the memory management routines are especially helpful for improving the
performance of memory-intensive applications.
