Window manager of the xfce project
	
this package contains xfwm4 which is the window manager for xfce4.  it is
designed to run with the rest of xfce4 but makes a capable window manager
for gnome or kde.

install xfwm4 if you want a small, resource saving window manager which
complies to the standards defined at http://www.freedesktop.org/. without
xfce4 installed this only gives you a window manager not the full
environment.
