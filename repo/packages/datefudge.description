Fake the system date
	
this program (and preload library) fakes the system date so that
programs think the wall clock is ... different.

the faking is not complete; timestamp on files are not affected in any
way.

this package is useful if you want to test the date handling of your
programs without changing the system clock. examples: does it handle
expired certificates correctly? does it work on a leap day?
