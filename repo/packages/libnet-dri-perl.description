Interface to domain name registries/registrars/resellers
	
net::dri is a perl library to access services offered by domain name
providers, such as registries or registrars. dri stands for domain
registration interface and it aims to be for domain name
registries/registrars/resellers what dbi is for databases: an abstraction
over multiple providers, with multiple policies, transports and protocols all
used through a uniform api.
