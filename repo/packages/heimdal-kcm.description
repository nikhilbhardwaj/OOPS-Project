Heimdal kerberos - kcm daemon
	
heimdal is a free implementation of kerberos 5 that aims to be
compatible with mit kerberos.

this package includes the kcm daemon which can hold the credentials
for all users in the system. access control is done with unix-like
permissions. the daemon checks the access on all operations based on
the uid and gid of the user. the tickets are renewed as long as is
permitted by the kdc's policy.
