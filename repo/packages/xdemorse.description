Gtk+ morse code decoding software
	
xdemorse is a gtk+ graphical version of demorse, using the same decoding
engine. it has an fft-derived "waterfall" display of the incoming audio
signal's spectrum, as well as a 'scope-like display of the audio
detector's output and status of the mark/space discriminator ("slicer").
xdemorse also has cat for the ft-847 and this can be used to net the
receiver's frequency to the incoming signal, by clicking near its trace
in the waterfall display.
