Core library for gmerlin - documentation files
	
a multiformat media player with tree-like virtual directory structure,
where you can save your files, webstreams or whatever. gmerlin handles even
large media collections gracefully. hardware devices appear also in the
tree so you can open audio-cds, (s)vcds, dvds and dvb-broadcasts.

this package contains the documentation about libgmerlin.
