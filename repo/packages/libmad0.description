Mpeg audio decoder library
	
mad is an mpeg audio decoder. it currently only supports the mpeg 1
standard, but fully implements all three audio layers (layer i, layer ii,
and layer iii, the latter often colloquially known as mp3.)

mad has the following special features:

  - 100% fixed-point (integer) computation
  - completely new implementation based on the iso/iec 11172-3 standard
  - distributed under the terms of the gnu general public license (gpl)
