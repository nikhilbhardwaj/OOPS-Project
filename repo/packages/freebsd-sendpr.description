send-pr is a client utility for sending problem reports to a remote gnats
database. this is the freebsd version of send-pr, which contains a number
of enhancements, and is primarily targeted at sending reports to the freebsd

it is useful for debian maintainers (or even users) of software originated in
freebsd, as it provides an easy way to send patches or feedback to upstream.
