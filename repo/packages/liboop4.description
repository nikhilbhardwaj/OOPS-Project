Event loop management library
	
liboop is a low-level event loop management library for posix-based
operating systems. it supports the development of modular, multiplexed
applications which may respond to events from several sources. it
replaces the "select() loop" and allows the registration of event
handlers for file and network i/o, timers and signals. since processes
use these mechanisms for almost all external communication, liboop can
be used as a basis for almost any application.
