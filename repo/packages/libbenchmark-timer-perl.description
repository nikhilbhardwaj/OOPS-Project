Benchmarking with statistical confidence
	
the benchmark::timer class allows you to time portions of code conveniently,
as well as benchmark code by allowing timings of repeated trials. it is
perfect for when you need more precise information about the running time of
portions of your code than the benchmark module will give you, but don't want
to go all out and profile your code.
