Gnu r multi-state markov and hidden markov models in continuous time
	
functions for fitting general continuous-time markov and hidden markov
multi-state models to longitudinal data. both markov transition rates and the
hidden markov output process can be modelled in terms of covariates. a variety
of observation schemes are supported, including processes observed at arbitrary
times, completely-observed processes, and censored states.
