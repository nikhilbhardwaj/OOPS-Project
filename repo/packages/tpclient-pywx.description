Thousand parsec python client
	
a python wxgtk client to connect to the thousand parsec game world.

thousand parsec is a framework for turn based space empire building games.

thousand parsec is not a game by itself, it is a frame work for creating
a similar group of games. some of the games, such as the first demo game
minisec, are developed by the thousand parsec developers themselves.
in the near future it is hoped that other developers will create their
own games using thousand parsec.
