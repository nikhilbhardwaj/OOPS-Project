Perl module to match delimited substrings
	
delimmatch allows you to match delimited substrings in a buffer. the
delimiters can be specified with any regular expression and the start
and end delimiters need not be the same. if the delimited text is
properly nested, entire nested groups are returned.

in addition, you may specify quoting and escaping characters that
contribute to the recognition of start and end delimiters.
