Command line hdr manipulation programs
	
pfstools is a set of command line (and two gui) programs for reading,
writing, manipulating and viewing high-dynamic range (hdr) images and video
frames. all programs in this package exchange data using a simple generic
file format (pfs) for hdr data. it is an attempt to integrate existing file
formats by providing a simple data format that can be used to exchange data
between applications.

the concept of pfstools is similar to netpbm for low-dynamic range images.
