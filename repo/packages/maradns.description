Simple security-focused domain name service server
	
an easy to configure dns server that functions as a
recursive and/or authoritative name server. maradns is
optimised for serving a small number of domains quickly and
efficiently. well suited to host your own private dns server
for making up subdomains with minimal fuss. maradns is
security-aware by utilising a special string library which
is resistant to buffer overflows and mandating to run as an
unprivileged user.
