A c programmer's library that removes accents from a string
	
unac is a c programmer's library that removes accents from a string.
for instance the string été will become ete.  it provides a command
line interface that removes accents from a input flow or a string
given in argument (unaccent command). in the library function and the
command, the charset of the input is specified as an argument. the
input is converted to utf-16 using iconv(3), accents are stripped and
the result is converted back to the original charset. the iconv --list
command on gnu/linux will show all charset supported.
