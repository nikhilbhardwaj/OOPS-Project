Module to test for pod errors
	
test::pod is a simple test for perl's plain old documentation (pod) format. it
checks your distribution's module, script and documentation files for issues
with the documentation syntax. in the cpan community, it is considered a best
practice to use this module as an author test prior to releasing your packages
because it prevents issues with various applications that use the pod.
