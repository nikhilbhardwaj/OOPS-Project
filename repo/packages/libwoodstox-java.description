A high-performance xml processor
	
woodstox is a high-performance validating namespace-aware
stax-compliant (jsr-173) open source xml-processor written in
java. xml processor means that it handles both input (parsing) and
output (writing, serialization), as well as supporting tasks such
as validation.

this library is needed for the freecol package, and will probably be
of interest for others.
