An irc bot, written in erlang
	
manderlbot is an irc bot with xml configuration file, allowing you to launch
it on several servers and channels at once, each channel will have its own
set of behaviours.

behaviours are generics, and you can easily make your own set. if you want
some not-already-implemented generic behaviour, you'll have to code some
erlang.
