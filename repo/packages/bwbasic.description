Bywater basic interpreter
	
the bywater basic interpreter (bwbasic) implements a large superset
of the ansi standard for minimal basic (x3.60-1978) and a significant
subset of the ansi standard for full basic (x3.113-1987) in c.  it
also offers shell programming facilities as an extension of basic.
bwbasic seeks to be as portable as possible.
