Concurrent programming library for ocaml
	
this library enhances the threads library of the standard ocaml distribution
in two dimensions:

- it implements the same api of the standard threads library on different
execution engines (process, networker), so that a single copy of
source code can be compiled and deployed to different environments
without modification.
- it is also a super set of the standard threads library, with extra
components (stm etc.), functions (spawn etc.) and features (object-level
compatibility etc.).

this package provides static libraries, interfaces, and documentation
for cothreads.
