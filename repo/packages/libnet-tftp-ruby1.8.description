This is a pure ruby implementation of tftp
	
it is used by many devices to upload or download their configuration,
firmware or else. it is a very simple file transfer protocol built on top
of udp. it transmits data by chunk of 512 bytes. it waits for an ack after
each data packet but does not do any data integrity checks.
there is no authentication mechanism nor any way too list the content of
the remote directories. it just sends or retrieves files.
