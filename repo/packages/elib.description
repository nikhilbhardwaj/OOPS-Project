Library of commonly-used emacs functions
	
elib is designed to be for elisp programs what libg++ is
for c++ programs:  a collection of useful routines which don't have to
be reinvented each time a new program is written.

elib contains code for:

 - container data structures (queues, stacks, avl trees, etc)
 - string handling functions missing in standard emacs
 - minibuffer handling functions missing in standard emacs
 - routines for handling lists of so called cookies in a buffer.
