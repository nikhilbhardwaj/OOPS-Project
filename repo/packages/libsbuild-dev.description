Development files for the debian source builder
	
sbuild provides facilities to manage and access chroots, as part of
schroot.

schroot allows users to execute commands or interactive shells in
different chroots.  any number of named chroots may be created, and
access permissions given to each, including root access for normal
users, on a per-user or per-group basis.  additionally, schroot can
switch to a different user in the chroot, using pam for
authentication and authorisation.  all operations are logged for
security.

this package contains the header files and static library needed to
develop applications which make use of sbuild.  once the api and abi
are stable, a shared library will replace the static library.
