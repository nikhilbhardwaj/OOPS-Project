Plugins for vdr to show some possible features
	
video disk recorder (vdr) is a digital sat-receiver program using
linux and dvb technologies. it allows one to record mpeg2 streams,
as well as output the stream to tv.

this package contains the example-plugins hello, osddemo, svccli,
svcsvr, skincurses, status and svdrpdemo from the vdr-source.
these plugins do not have useful features, they only demonstrate
how vdr-plugins work and what is possible to do with them.
