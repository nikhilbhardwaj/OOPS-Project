Library for reading dvds
	
libdvdread provides the functionality that is required to access many dvds. it
parses ifo files, reads nav-blocks, and performs css authentication and
descrambling.

libdvdread probes for libdvdcss at runtime and if found, will use it to
decrypt sections of the dvd as necessary. libdvdcss needs to be installed from
third-party repositories (see readme.debian), it's not included in debian.
