Remote execution of xwindow programs
	
xrsh is designed to allow you to start an x client on a remote machine
with the window displayed on the current server's $display.  it has
many options that give you the ability to propagate environment
variables (including display) to the remote system and works with
various types of x server access control including xauth and xhost.
xrlogin opens a local xterm window and runs rlogin (or optionally telnet) to
connect to a remote machine.
