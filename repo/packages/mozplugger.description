Plugin allowing external viewers to be launched inside mozilla
	
mozplugger allows you to seamlessly integrate external applications
to view files downloaded from the web that mozilla can not normally
handle. the application is embedded within a mozilla window as to act
like and feel like a true plugin.

this allows you to view pdfs, postscript files, animations and
movies, amongst other file types all from within mozilla (with
supporting applications).
