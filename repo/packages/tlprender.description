Off-screen renderer for tulip graphs
	
tulip is capable of managing graphs with up to 500,000 nodes and edges
on relatively modest hardware (eg. 600mhz pentium iii, 256mb ram).

this package uses mesa off-screen rendering capabilities to render
graphs to a png file and html map.  it is most useful with the
plugins shipped in the tulip package.
