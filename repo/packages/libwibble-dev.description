Library of various useful c++ code
	
libwibble collects the foundation code that has been used over time
in various c++ projects by peter rockai and enrico zini, so that it can
be maintained properly and in a single place.

the code has minimal dependencies, a test suite, and can be used either as an
external library or embedded in projects based on either cmake or autotools.

the library contains:

 * an exception hierarchy;
 * various useful mixin classes;
 * shortcuts for set operations;
 * a featureful self-documenting commandline parser that also supports
   cvs/svn-style subcommands;
 * two different unit-testing system, a tut-based and a custom one;
 * a non-intrusive polymorphic envelope;
 * a logging system;
 * string functions, like splitting, path manipulation, regular
   expressions and word wrapping;
 * system functions, like directory iteration, file manipulation, process
   control, thread functions;
 * gregorian calendar operations.
