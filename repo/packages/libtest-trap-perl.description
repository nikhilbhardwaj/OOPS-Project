Test module to trap exit codes, exceptions, output, etc.
	
test::trap is a perl test module useful primarily (but not exclusively) for
test scripts: a block eval on steroids, configurable and extensible, but by
default trapping (perl) stdout, stderr, warnings, exceptions, would-be exit
codes, and return values from boxed blocks of test code.

the values collected by the latest trap can then be queried or tested through
as a special trap object.
