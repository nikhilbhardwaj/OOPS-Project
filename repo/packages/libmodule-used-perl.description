Library to detect modules loaded by perl code without running it
	
module::used is a perl module that does static analysis of arbitrary perl
code, looking for use and require statements to determine what modules are
required by the code. it also knows about moose and moose::role, so it can
determine appropriate dependencies in that case too.
