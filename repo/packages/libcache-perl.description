The cache interface
	
the cache modules are designed to assist a developer in persisting data for a
specified period of time.  often these modules are used in web applications to
store data locally to save repeated and redundant expensive calls to remote
machines or databases.

the cache interface is implemented by derived classes that store cached data
in different manners (such as as files on a filesystem, or in memory).
