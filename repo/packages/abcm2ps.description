Translates abc music description files to postscript
	
this is the debian port of the abcm2ps program by jean-fran√ßois moine.
the program translates tunes written in the abc format to postscript,
which can then be viewed using ghostview et al. or printed on a
postscript printer or through ghostscript. it supports various
semi-standard extensions to the abc standard, such as multiple
voices and staves.

this program is a vastly improved spin-off from michael methfessel's
abc2ps, which is no longer supplied as part of debian. in particular,
it contains a lot of extensions to help typeset classical music.
