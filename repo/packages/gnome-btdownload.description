Gnome interface for 'executing' bittorrent files
	
a simple gnome interface designed as a mime-sink for bittorrent files.
gnome-btdownload allows a user to download files using bittorrent,
a scatter-gather network.

not a front-end, more-or-less just a session dialog. see bittorrent
for more information.
