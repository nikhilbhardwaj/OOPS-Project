Debootstrap-based instance os definition for ganeti
	
ganeti is a virtual server cluster management software tool built on
top of the xen virtual machine monitor and other open source software.
after setting it up it will provide you with an automated environment
to manage highly available virtual machine instances.

this package provides an os definition for ganeti that will allow
installation of debian (and possibly unbuntu) instances via
debootstrap.
