Scan/change symbolic links
	
symlinks scans directories for symbolic links and lists
them on stdout. each link is prefixed with a classification
of relative, absolute, dangling, messy, lengthy or other_fs.

symlinks can also convert absolute links (within the same filesystem)
to relative links and can delete messy and dangling links.
