Wu-manber algorithm for string searching with errors
	
this ocaml library implements the wu-manber algorithm for string searching
with errors, popularized by the "agrep" unix command and the "glimpse" file
indexing tool. it was developed as part of a search engine for a largish mp3
collection; the "with error" searching comes handy for those who can't spell
liszt or shostakovitch.

given a search pattern and a string, this algorithm determines whether the
string contains a substring that matches the pattern up to a parameterizable
number n of "errors". an "error" is either a substitution (replace a
character of the string with another character), a deletion (remove a
character) or an insertion (add a character to the string). in more
scientific terms, the number of errors is the levenshtein edit distance
between the pattern and the matched substring.

the search patterns are roughly those of the unix shell, including
one-character wildcard (?), character classes ([0-9]) and multi-character
wildcard (*). in addition, conjunction (&) and alternative (|) are supported.
general regular expressions are not supported, however.

this package contains all the development stuff you need to use
the agrep ocaml library in your programs.
