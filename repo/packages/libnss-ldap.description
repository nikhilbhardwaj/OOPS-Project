Nss module for using ldap as a naming service
	
this package provides a name service switch that allows your ldap server
act as a name service. this means providing user account information,
group id's, host information, aliases, netgroups, and basically anything
else that you would normally get from /etc flat files or nis.

if used with glibc 2.1's nscd (name service cache daemon) it will help
reduce your network traffic and speed up lookups for entries.
