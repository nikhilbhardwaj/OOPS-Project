Fast light toolkit - shared libraries with debugging symbols
	
this package is useful to provide a backtrace with symbol names in a
debugger; this facilitates interpretation of core dumps, and aids in finding
logic errors in programs using the libraries (or in the
libraries themselves).

non-programmers will likely have little use for this.

the fast light toolkit (fltk) is a cross-platform graphical user interface
toolkit originally based on libforms.
