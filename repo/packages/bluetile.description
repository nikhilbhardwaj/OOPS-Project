Full-featured tiling for the gnome desktop environment
	
bluetile is a tiling window manager designed to integrate with the
gnome desktop environment. it provides both a traditional, stacking
layout mode as well as tiling layouts where windows are arranged to
use the entire screen without overlapping. bluetile tries to make the
tiling paradigm easily accessible to users coming from traditional
window managers by drawing on known conventions and providing both
mouse and keyboard access for all features.
