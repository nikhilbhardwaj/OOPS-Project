Minimalist roaraudio client library (development headers)
	
roaraudio is a sound-server for audio mixing. its main purpose is to mix audio
from different clients before sending it to its outputs (for example a
soundcard).

it is completely network transparent (unix sockets and tcp/ip) and supports
many common codecs like ogg vorbis, speex or flac.

this is a minimalist client library for roaraudio.
it exists because it allows non-gpl applications to use
the roaraudio sound system.

this package contains the development headers for the libmuroar library.
