Perl test module for tracing memory leaks
	
test::leaktrace provides several functions that detect and trace memory leaks.
this module scans arenas, the memory allocation system, so it can detect any
leaked scalar values (svs) in given blocks. leaked svs are those which are not
released after the end of the scope they have been created, including internal
caches and global variables.
