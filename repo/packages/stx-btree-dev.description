B+tree implementation in c++
	
the stx b+ tree package is a set of c++ template classes
implementing a b+ tree key/data container in main memory.
designed to be drop-in replacements  of the stl containers
set, map, multiset and multimap and follow their interfaces very closely.
by packing multiple value pairs into each node
of the tree the b+ tree reduces heap fragmentation and utilizes cache-line
effects better than the standard red-black binary tree.
the classes contain extensive assertion and verification mechanisms
to ensure the implementation's correctness by testing the tree invariants.
to illustrate the  b+ tree's structure a wxwidgets demo program is included
in the stx-btree-demo package.
