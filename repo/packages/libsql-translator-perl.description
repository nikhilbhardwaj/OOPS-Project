Sql translation library
	
sql::translator (also known as sql fairy) is a collection of perl modules
for manipulating structured data definitions (mostly database schemas). it
can perform tasks like converting between different sql data definition
language (ddl) dialects, visualizations of schemas (pseudo-er diagrams
created with gd or graphviz), converting non-rdbms files to sql schemas
(xsv text files, excel spreadsheets), serializing parsed schemas (via
storable, yaml and xml), creating documentation, and more.
