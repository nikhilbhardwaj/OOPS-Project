Code to benchmark speed of octave
	
this package contains a collection of routines to benchmark speed of
octave, a numerical computation software.  it contains functions to
test dense transposed matrix-matrix and matrix-vector multiplication,
array indexing, integer math & conversions, array permuting, sparse
transposed matrix-vector multiplication, as well as tools for
controlling the benchmark.

this octave add-on package is part of the octave-forge project.
