Performance co-pilot library
	
the libpcp package contains the runtime environment required by
programs that make use of performance co-pilot (pcp) services.

the performance co-pilot provides a unifying abstraction for
all of the interesting performance data in a system, and allows
client applications to easily retrieve and process any subset of
that data.
