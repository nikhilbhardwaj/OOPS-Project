Qemu user mode emulation binaries (static version)
	
qemu is a fast processor emulator: currently the package supports
arm, cris, i386, m68k (coldfire), microblaze, mips, powerpc, sh4,
sparc and x86-64 emulation. by using dynamic translation it achieves
reasonable speed while being easy to port on new host cpus.

this package provides the user mode emulation binaries, built
statically. in this mode qemu can launch linux processes compiled for
one cpu on another cpu.
