Graphical interface to sleuthkit
	
the autopsy forensic browser is a graphical interface to the command line
digital forensic analysis tools in the sleuth kit. together, the sleuth kit
and autopsy provide many of the same features as commercial digital forensics
tools for the analysis of windows and unix file systems (ntfs, fat, ffs,
ext2fs, and ext3fs).
