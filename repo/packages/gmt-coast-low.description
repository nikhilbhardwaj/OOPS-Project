Low resolution coastlines for the generic mapping tools
	
this package contains the crude, low and intermediate resolution coastlines
contained in the gmt distribution which will be enough to get you started.
originally there were two more coastline packages (gmt-coast-high and -full)
but they were to big for our servers and pulled from the distribution.

read /usr/share/doc/gmt-coast-low/readme.debian to learn how to get coastline
data on the net. otherwise you will not be able to create high quality
maps with gmt.
