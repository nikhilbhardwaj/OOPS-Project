figlet is a program that creates large characters out of ordinary screen
characters.  it can create characters in many different styles and can
kern and "smush" these characters together in various ways.  figlet
output is generally reminiscent of the sort of "signatures" many people
like to put at the end of e-mail and usenet messages.
