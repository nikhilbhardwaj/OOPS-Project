Geomatic library to compute neighbourhood population potential
	
hyantes aims to develop new methods for the cartographic representation of
human distributions (population density, population increase, etc.) with
various smoothing functions and opportunities for time-scale animations
of maps.
it provides a smoothing method related to multiscalar neighbourhood
density estimation.
