Python support for magics++
	
magics++ is the latest generation of the ecmwf's meteorological plotting
software magics. although completely redesigned in c++, it is intended to be
as backwards-compatible as possible with the fortran interface.
besides its programming interfaces (fortran and c), magics++ offers magml,
a plot description language based on xml aimed at automatic web production.

this package provides python support for the magics++ library.
