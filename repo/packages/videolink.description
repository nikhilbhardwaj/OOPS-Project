Assembles a dvd video filesystem from html pages and video files
	
videolink is intended to provide a simple way of producing dvds with
attractive and usable menus.  it converts html pages into dvd menus by
rendering them in mozilla and reproducing their link structure.  this
allows you to design dvds using familiar html editing tools or your
favourite text editor.
