Ldap fai module for the tftp/fuse supplicant
	
fai module for fts which is using the ldap backend in conjunction
with gosa and goto to generate client configurations.

the fts daemon has been designed with modularity in mind. it
allows dynamic configurations generated from other sources like
i.e. ldap or opsi configuration.
