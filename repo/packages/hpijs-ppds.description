Hp linux printing and imaging - hpijs ppd files
	
this package contains ppd (printer definition) files for the
printers supported through the hp linux printing and imaging
system hpijs driver.

these ppds should work well with the matching versions of hplip
and hpijs, but may not be the most up-to-date ppds available for
a given printer.  see http://www.openprinting.org/ for the latest
version of the ppds (which are not guaranteed to work well).
