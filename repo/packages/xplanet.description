Planetary body renderer
	
xplanet renders an image of a planet into an x window or a file. all
of the major planets and most satellites can be drawn, and different
map projections are also supported, including azimuthal, hemisphere,
lambert, mercator, mollweide, peters, polyconic, and rectangular.

in order to run xplanet, you'll need at least one map file. some maps
are included in the xplanet-images package.
