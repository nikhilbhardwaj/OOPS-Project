Small ruby web framework for model-view-controller type applications
	
camping is a web framework which consistently stays at less than 4kb of
code.  the idea here is to store a complete fledgling web application
(written in ruby) in a single file like many small cgis, but to organize
it as a model-view-controller application like rails does.  you can then
easily move it to rails once you've got it going.
