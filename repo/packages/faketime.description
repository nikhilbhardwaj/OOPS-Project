Report faked system time to programs
	
the fake time preload library (ftpl, a.k.a. libfaketime) intercepts
various system calls which programs use to retrieve the current date
and time. it can then report faked dates and times (as specified by
you, the user) to these programs. this means you can modify the
system time a program sees without having to change the time
system-wide. ftpl allows you to specify both absolute dates (e.g.,
2004-01-01) and relative dates (e.g., 10 days ago).
