Simplified low-level i/o layer
	
xnio is a simplified low-level i/o layer which can be used anywhere you are
using nio today. it frees you from the hassle of dealing with selectors and
the lack of nio support for multicast sockets and non-socket i/o such as
serial ports, while still maintaining all the capabilities present in nio.
also, xnio vastly simplifies implementation of channels, opening the door to
supporting higher-level transport concepts (like ssl or virtual channels) with
the same simple api.
