Clirr maven plugin
	
clirr is a tool that checks java libraries for binary and source compatibility
with older releases. basically you give it two sets of jar files and clirr
dumps out a list of changes in the public api. the clirr-maven-plugin can
be configured to break the build, if it detects incompatible api changes.
in a continuous integration process, the clirr-maven-plugin can automatically
prevent accidental introduction of binary or source compatibility problems.
additionally, the plugin can generate a report as part of the generated
site.
