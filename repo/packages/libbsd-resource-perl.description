Bsd process resource limit and priority functions
	
the bsd::resource module provides the bsd process resource limit functions
getrusage(), getrlimit(), setrlimit() and the bsd process priority functions.

these are also available via core perl but here the prio_* constants are
available: getpriority(), setpriority().

also provided is times() which provides the same functionality as the one
in core perl, only with better time resolution.
