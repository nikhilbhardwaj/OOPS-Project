Daemon to synchronize local directories using rsync
	
lsyncd (live syncing mirror daemon) uses rsync to synchronize local
directories with a remote machine running rsyncd. lsyncd watches
multiple directories trees through inotify. the first step after
adding the watches is to rsync all directories with the remote host,
and then sync single file by collecting the inotify events. so lsyncd
is a light-weight live mirror solution that should be easy to install
and use while blending
well with your system.
