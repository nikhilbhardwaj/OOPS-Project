Unpack (almost) everything with one command
	
unp is a small perl script which makes extraction of any archive files
a bit easier. it support several compressors and archiver programs,
chooses the right one(s) automatically and extracts one or more files
in one go.

you may also want to install some non-free packages like "unace-nonfree",
"unrar-nonfree" and "lha" to extract archives of these types.
