Simple data caching service with time history
	
cache::historical provides simple methods to store and search text values
that are tied to a time and a key, like user or category. each caching
operation sets a time stamp, thus making it possible to search according
to events in time. like the name suggests, it was originally conceived
for recording of historic events such as stock trading.

this module uses sqlite3 as database backend, thus leaving ample space
for costumized additional tools to the same cached historic data.
