Lightweight c library for loading and writing png images
	
it was created as a substitute for libpng in situations when libpng is more
than enough. it currently requires zlib for inflate and crc checking and it
can read the most common types of png images. the library has a small and
simple to use interface.

this package provides the header files and static libraries.
