the package provides an alternative runtime using the zero vm and the
shark just in time compiler (jit).  built on architectures in addition
to the hotspot vm as a debugging aid for those architectures which don't
have a hotspot vm.

the vm is started with the option `-zero'. see the readme.debian for details.
