Uncompress and extract samples from mo3 modules
	
the mo3 format means "module with mp3", because the main initial idea was to
reduce the size of a module (in .mod, it, xm) by compressing the samples
using mpeg audio layer 3. the samples can be compressed using ogg, mp3, and
two kind of specific lossless algorithms.
