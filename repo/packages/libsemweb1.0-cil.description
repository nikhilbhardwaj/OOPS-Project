Semantic web/rdf library
	
semweb is a semantic web/rdf library written in c# for mono and microsoft .net
framework. the library can be used for reading and writing rdf (xml, n3),
keeping rdf in persistent storage (memory, mysql, etc.), querying persistent
storage via simple graph matching and sparql, and making sparql queries to
remote endpoints. limited rdfs and general-purpose inferencing is also
possible.
