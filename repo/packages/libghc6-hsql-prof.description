Multi-database interface system profiling library for ghc6
	
hsql provides interfaces for haskell programmers to the postgresql,
mysql, sqlite, and unixodbc database systems.  there is a generic
abstract interface so that code can be used interchangeably with these
database systems.  in this sense, it is similar to java's jdbc,
python's db-api, or perl's dbi.
