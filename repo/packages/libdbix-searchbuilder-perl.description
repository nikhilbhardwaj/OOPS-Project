Perl implementation of a simple orm
	
dbix::searchbuilder is a simple implementation of an object-relational mapper
(orm). it provides an object-oriented mechanism for retrieving and updating
data in a dbi-accessible database. this module is similar in nature to other,
more popular, solutions like rose::db::object (see librose-db-object-perl) and
dbix::class (libdbix-class-perl).
