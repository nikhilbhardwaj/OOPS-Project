Pthread stubs not provided by native libc
	
this library provides weak aliases for pthread functions not provided
in libc or otherwise available by default.  libraries like libxcb rely
on pthread stubs to use pthreads optionally, becoming thread-safe when
linked to libpthread, while avoiding any performance hit when running
single-threaded. libpthread-stubs supports this behavior even on
platforms which do not supply all the necessary pthread stubs.  on
platforms which already supply all the necessary pthread stubs, this
package has no content.
