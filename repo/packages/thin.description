Fast and very simple ruby web server (metapackage)
	
thin is a ruby web server that glues together 3 of the best ruby
libraries in web history:

  * the mongrel parser, the root of mongrel's speed and security
  * event machine, a network i/o library with extremely high
    scalability, performance and stability
  * rack, a minimal interface between webservers and ruby frameworks


which makes it, with all humility, the most secure, stable, fast and
extensible ruby web server bundled in an easy to use package for your own
pleasure.

this is a metapackage which depends on the version of thin for the
current version of ruby. it also provides the /usr/bin/thin symlinks.
