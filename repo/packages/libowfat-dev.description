this library is a reimplementation of libdjb, which means that it provides
daniel bernstein's interfaces (with some extensions).

it contains wrappers around memory allocation, buffered i/o, routines for
formatting and scanning, a full dns resolver, several socket routines,
wrappers for socket functions, mkfifo, opendir, wait, and an abstraction
around errno.  it also includes wrappers for unix signal functions and a
layer of mmap and sendfile.

the library is available for use with the diet libc.
