Error-tolerant html parser for python
	
the beautifulsoup class turns arbitrarily bad html into a tree-like nested
tag-soup list of tag objects and text snippets. a tag object corresponds to
an html tag.  it knows about the html tag's attributes, and contains a
representation of everything contained between the original tag and its
closing tag (if any). it's easy to extract tags that meet certain criteria.
