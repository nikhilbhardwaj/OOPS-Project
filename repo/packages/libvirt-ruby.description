Ruby bindings for libvirt
	
this library provides ruby bindings for using libvirt.

libvirt is a toolkit to interact with the virtualization capabilities
of recent versions of linux (and other oses). the library aims at providing
a long term stable c api for different virtualization mechanisms. it currently
supports qemu, kvm, and xen.

this is a dependency package which depends on debian's default ruby version
(currently 1.8).
