Upload photos to flickr
	
postr is a flickr  uploading tool for the gnome desktop, which aims to be
simple to use but exposing enough of flickr to be useful.

it has a simple user interface, and lets you set common attributes for
your photos: title, description, tags, sets, groups, privacy, licence, etc.

it is integrated with nautilus: you can either run postr when you are
browsing your photos or just drag them from nautilus to drop them in postr.
