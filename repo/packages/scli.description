A collection of snmp command line management tools
	
the scli package was written in order to have small and efficient command
line utility to monitor and configure network devices and host systems. the
scli package is based on the snmp management protocol and it utilizes a

snmp knowledge is required in order to extend the scli programs with new
features.
