Rfc 822/2068 header and unheader functions
	
this module provides two new functions, header and unheader,
which provide general-purpose rfc 822 header construction and parsing.
they do not provide any intelligent defaults of http-specific methods.
they are simply aimed at providing an easy means to address the
mechanics of header parsing.

the output style is designed to mimic cgi.pm and http::headers,
so that users familiar with these interfaces will feel at home with
these functions.
