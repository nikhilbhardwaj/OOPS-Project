Sony vaio controller program to set lcd backlight brightness
	
spicctrl is a small program that can use the sony programmable i/o control
device (spic), which is part of sony vaio's, to do a few simple things.
currently, it can only be used to control the brightness on the lcd
backlight, and print out some information about the battery.

you need a kernel with the sonypi module (and a vaio laptop..) to use this
program.
