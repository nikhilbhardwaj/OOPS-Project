Acts as an interface to various online weather-services
	
services_weather searches for given locations and retrieves current
weather data and, dependent on the used service, also forecasts. up to
now, globalweather from capescience, weather xml from ejse (us only),
a xoap service from weather.com and metar/taf from noaa are supported.
further services will get included, if they become available, have a
usable api and are properly documented.
