Small xml parser for java
	
nanoxml is a (actually more than one) small xml parser for java. it
provides the java packages net.n3.nanoxml.*, net.n3.nanoxml.sax.* and
nanoxml.* in nanoxml2.jar, nanoxml2-sax.jar and nanoxml2-lite.jar.
the package nanoxml.* is source compatible with nanoxml 1 but is more
restrictive on what it will parse than nanoxml 1.
