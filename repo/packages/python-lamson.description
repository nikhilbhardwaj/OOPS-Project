A pure python smtp server
	
lamson is a pure python smtp server designed to create robust and
complex mail applications in the style of modern web frameworks such as
django. unlike traditional smtp servers like postfix or sendmail,
lamson has all the features of a web application stack (orm, templates,
routing, handlers, state machines, python) without needing to configure
alias files, run newaliases, or juggle tons of tiny fragile processes.
lamson also plays well with other web frameworks and python libraries.
