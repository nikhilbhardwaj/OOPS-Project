Module to use real libraries from within mocked libraries
	
when mocking modules using 'mocked', you are certain that no extra "real"
libraries are being loaded.  but sometimes you don't want to use real
libraries from within your mocked library.  this module allows you to load
real libraries using your previous include paths.
