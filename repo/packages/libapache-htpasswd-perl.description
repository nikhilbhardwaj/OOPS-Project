Manage unix crypt-style password file
	
this module comes with a set of methods to use with htaccess password
files. these files (and htaccess) are used to do basic authentication
on a web server.

the passwords file is a flat-file with login name and their associated
crypted password. you can use this for non-apache files if you wish, but
it was written specifically for .htaccess style files.
