Utility to read exif tags from a digital camera jpeg file
	
the exiftags utility parses a specified jpeg file or, by default, its
standard input, looking for a jpeg app1 section containing exif
(exchangeable image file) data. the properties contained in these
data are then printed to the standard output. digital cameras typically
add exif data to the image files they produce, containing information
about the camera and digitized image.
