Haskell sha suite of message digest functions - ghc 6 libraries
	
this library implements the sha suite of message digest functions,
according to nist fips 180-2 (with the sha-224 addendum), as well
as the sha-based hmac routines.

the functions have been tested  against most of the nist and rfc test
vectors for the various functions. while some attention has been paid
to performance, these do not presently reach the speed of well-tune
libraries, like openssl.

this package contains the libraries compiled for ghc 6.
