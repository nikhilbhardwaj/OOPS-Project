A library for parsing, sorting and filtering your mail
	
this code is a standalone library based upon code which had been distributed
with the cyrus mail server. currently libsieve implements two apis:
one that is based upon, and compatible with, the sieve api as built into
the cyrus mail server, as well as a new api which is very well suited to
be incorporated into other programs and is reasonably extensible.

this package contains the development files.
