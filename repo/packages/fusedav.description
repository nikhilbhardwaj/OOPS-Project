Filesystem to mount webdav shares
	
fusedav is a userspace filesystem driver that allows you to mount webdav
shares. this way you can transparently edit and manage files on a remote
server.

it uses fuse (filesystem in userspace), thus you need a fuse-enabled kernel.

webdav (web-based distributed authoring and versioning) is a set of
extensions to the http protocol which allows users to collaboratively edit
and manage files on remote web servers.
