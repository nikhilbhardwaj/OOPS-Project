Perl dom implementation for makefiles
	
makefile::dom serves as an advanced lexer for (gnu) makefiles. it losslessly
parses makefiles as "documents". the results are data structures similar to dom
trees, holding every single bit of the information in the original input files,
including white spaces, blank lines and makefile comments, so it's possible to
reproduce the original makefiles from the dom trees. in addition, each node of
the dom trees is modifiable and so is the whole tree.
