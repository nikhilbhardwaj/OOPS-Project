Tint is not tetris(tm) ...at least the name isn't
	
as the title suggests, this is a clone of the original tetris game
written by alexey pajitnov, dmitry pavlovsky, and vadim gerasimov.

the game is as close to the original as possible, but there are a few
differences.  nevertheless, it's probably the closest to the original
that you'll ever find in the unix world...
