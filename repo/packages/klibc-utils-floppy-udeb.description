Small utilities built with klibc for the boot floppy
	
this package contains a small collection of programs that are linked
against klibc. these duplicate some of the functionality of a
regular linux toolset, but are typically much smaller than their
full-function counterparts.  they are intended for inclusion in
boot floppies.
