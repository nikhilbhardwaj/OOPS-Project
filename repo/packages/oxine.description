Xine osd (on screen display) gui
	
oxine is a lightweight, purely osd-based xine frontend for set-top boxes and
home entertainment systems. it uses the on screen display functionality of xine
to display its user interface elements like buttons, lists, sliders, and so on.
due to this, oxine can easily use any video output device the xine library
provides.
