Python cdb (constant database) library
	
d. j. bernstein's cdb library adapted as a python extension module. you
probably already know that cdb files are mappings of keys to values (c.f.,
dbm and friends), designed for wickedly fast lookups and atomic updates.

this interface presents cdb files as (surprise!) mapping objects with a few
special features. in general, the module tries to mimic the functionality of
the normal cdb utilities.
