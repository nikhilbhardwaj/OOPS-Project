Flow analysis and fingerprinting component of the eresi framework
	
libmjollnir it is the main receipt of all the original api for code
analysis in eresi. it can do a control flow graphs and call graphs with
function pointers, perform an 'unstrip', fingerprint functions using
hashing algorithms like md5 and prepare control flow and function call
graphs which can be accessed by containers api.

the main features of this library are :


 * api and generic container data structures for binary analysis.
 * construction of control flow graphs.
 * construction of call graphs.
 * fingerprinting of function blocks using hashing algorithms.
 * 'recovery' (unstrip without original names) of the symbol table.
 * function pointers recognition.
 * entry point fingerprinting.


this package contains the development files provided by libmjollnir
(the static library - i.e the .a file - and the libmjollnir headers).
