little robot, then watch him explore a world. the world is filled with
baddies that can hurt you, objects that you can bump into, and food
that you can eat. the goal of the game is to collect as many prizes as
possible before you are killed by a baddie or you run out of energy.

programs for the robot are written in scheme.
