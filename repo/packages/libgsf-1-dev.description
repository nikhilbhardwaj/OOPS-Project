Structured file library - development files (basic version)
	
this package contains the development files used in building applications
that use the gnome structured file library.

the gnome structured file library aims to provide an efficient
extensible i/o abstraction for dealing with different structured file
formats. it is actively being developed and its api is still likely to
undergo significant changes (in particular, extensions).

this is the basic development package for the gnome structured file library.
it is not gnome-specific and thus does not depend on gnome libraries.
for gnome-specific extensions, use libgsf-gnome-1-dev.
