Your own document language (yodl) is a pre-document language
	
yodl is a package that implements a pre-document language and tools to
process it.  the idea of yodl is that you write up a document in a
pre-language, then use the tools (e.g. yodl2html) to convert it to some
final document language.  current converters are for html, man, latex
sgml and texinfo, a poor-man's text converter and an experimental xml
converter. main document types are
"article", "report", "book", "manpage" and "letter".
the yodl document language was  designed to be easy to use and extensible.
