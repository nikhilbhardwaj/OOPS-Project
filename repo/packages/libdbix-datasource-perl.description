Database-independent create and drop functions
	
this module implements create_database and drop_database functions for
databases.  it aims to provide a common interface to database creation and
deletion regardless of the actual database being used.

currently supported databases are mysql and postgresql.  assistance adding
support for other databases is welcomed and relatively simple - see
dbix::datasource::driver.
