A gambas information component
	
gambas is a programming language based on a basic interpreter with
object extensions - like visual basic, though it is not a clone!
it has many components for developing internationalized,
desktop-independent, database- and network-enabled applications.
even games can be developed very quickly using its rad environment.

this is a native gambas component to provide a lot of information about
the system where the application is executed.
