Create gallery thumbnails for website
	
webmagick provides a means of easily putting image collections on the
web. it recurses through directory trees, building html pages and
imagemap (gif or jpeg) files to allow the user to navigate through
collections of thumbnail images (somewhat similar to 'xv') and select
the images to view with a mouse click.
