Evaluate the statistical distribution of dice rolls
	
with dicelab you can express most dice rolls (and similar things) in a
functional language, and the either roll the expression, or evaulate the
statistical distribution. in the latter case you can choose whether you want to
simply roll and tally many times, or actually compute the distribution (which
is more precise, but takes a long time in some obscure cases).
