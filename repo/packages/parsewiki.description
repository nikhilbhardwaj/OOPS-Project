Documentation system based on ascii text
	
perl script that can be used to produce html, xhtml, latex or docbook/xml
from a simple ascii text source document, with minimum syntax rules.

the text markup is quite simple and allows us to create documents in
an easy and fast way.

the tool is not suitable for complex documents, but can be used to create
an initial version which can be further developed working on the generated
latex or docbook file.
