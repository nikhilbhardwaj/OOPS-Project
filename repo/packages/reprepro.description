Debian package repository producer
	
reprepro is a tool to manage a repository of debian packages
(.deb, .udeb, .dsc, ...). it stores files either being
injected manually or downloaded from some other repository
(partially) mirrored into one pool/ hierarchy.
managed packages and files are stored in a berkeley db,
so no database server is needed.
checking signatures of mirrored repositories and creating
signatures of the generated package indices is supported.
