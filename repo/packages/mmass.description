Mass spectrometry tool for proteomics
	
mmass is a free mass spectrum viewer/analyzer in which the
following proteomics-related tasks can be performed:


 - open raw text, mzxml and mzdata mass spectra;
 - define peak lists;
 - powerful mass spectrum viewer (zoom, cursor...);
 - data recalibration;
 - protein-only simulations;
 - online mascot searches.


this software is written with python, and the author claims that
writing new modules should be easy.
