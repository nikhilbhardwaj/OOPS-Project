Standards compliant simple to use wiki
	
dokuwiki is a wiki mainly aimed at creating documentation of any kind.
it is targeted at developer teams, workgroups and small companies. it
has a simple but powerful syntax which makes sure the datafiles remain
readable outside the wiki and eases the creation of structured texts.
all data is stored in plain text files -- no database is required.
