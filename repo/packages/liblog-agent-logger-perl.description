Extension for log::agent providing an application-level logging api
	
the log::agent::logger class defines a generic interface for
application logging. it must not be confused with the interface
provided by log::agent, which is meant to be used by re-usable
modules that do not wish to commit on a particular logging method,
so that they remain true building blocks.
