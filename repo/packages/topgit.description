A git patch queue manager
	
topgit manages a patch queue using git topic branches, one patch per
branch. it allows for patch dependencies and can thus manage
non-linear patch series.

topgit is a minimal layer on top of git, which does not limit use of
git's functionality (such as the index). it rigorously keeps history
until a patch is accepted upstream. it is also fully usable across
distributed repositories.
