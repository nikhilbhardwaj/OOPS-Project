Perl module to unbless objects
	
acme::damn provides a way to reverse the bless operation, which takes a
variable and associates it with a given class. one can use this module
to return the original reference; that is, prior to calling bless on it.

after using 'damn()' or custom aliases thereof, the blessed perl object
reference becomes a simple data type.
