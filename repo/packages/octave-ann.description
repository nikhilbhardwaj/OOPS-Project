Octave binding to the approximate nearest neighbors library
	
this package wraps the ann library into octave, a numerical
computation software. the ann library provides data structures and
functions for computing exact and approximate nearest neighbors on an
arbitrarily high dimensional point set.

this octave add-on package is part of the octave-forge project.
