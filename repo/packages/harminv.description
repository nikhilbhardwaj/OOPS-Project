Extraction of complex frequencies and amplitudes from time series
	
harminv is a free program to solve the problem of harmonic inversion, given
a discrete-time, finite-length signal that consists of a sum of finitely-many
sinusoids (possibly exponentially decaying) in a given bandwidth, it
determines the frequencies, decay constants, amplitudes, and phases of those
sinusoids.
