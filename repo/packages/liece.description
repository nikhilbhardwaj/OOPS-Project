Irc (internet relay chat) client for emacs
	
liece is based on irchat, simple irc client running under emacsen,
nevertheless nothing to do with irchat-2.4jp which has various features added
by japanese contributers (e.g. mule support, channel buffers).
we are going to full-replace to redesign thoroughly, and to stand up to
extension against arbitrary protocol backend. the most recent version of this
program has been almost completely rewritten from irchat.
