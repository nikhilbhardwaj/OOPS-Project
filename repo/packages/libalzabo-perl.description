Data modelling tool and rdbms-oo mapper
	
alzabo is a suite of modules with two core functions. its first use is as a
data modelling tool. through either a schema creation gui, a perl program, or
reverse engineering, you can create a set objects to represent a schema.

its second function is as an rdbms to object mapping system. once you have
created a schema, you can use the alzabo::runtime::table and
alzabo::runtime::row classes to access its data.
