An app for monitorin network load
	
a network interface monitor dockapp for window maker. it is designed to fit
well with dockapps like wmcpuload and wmmemmon. it tracks whether the
interface is functioning and displays current network interface throughput,
along with an auto-scaling graph of recent network activity (the graph
separates upstream and downstream traffic load cleanly without resorting to
colors).
