Integer factorization with the elliptic curve method (ecm)
	
pyecm is a python program to factor numbers using the elliptic curve method
(ecm).  it is relatively fast in that it can quickly factors numbers up to 50
digits.

because it is written in python, pyecm is very portable. it is also fairly
easy to use. use of python-gmpy and/or python-psyco will speed it up
immensely.
