Perl module to run commands simply, with detailed diagnostics
	
ipc::system::simple takes the hard work out of calling external commands; it
provides replacements for system() and the backtick operator that will either
succeed, or die with rich diagnostic messages on errors.

the module also includes the ability to specify acceptable exit values, trap
errors, or process diagnostics.
