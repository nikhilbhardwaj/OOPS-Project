Packet capture and interception for switched networks
	
4g8 allows you to capture traffic from a third party in a switched
environment at the expense of a slight increase in latency to that
third party host. utilizing arp cache poisoning, packet capture and
packet reconstruction techniques, 4g8 works with nearly all tcp, icmp
and udp ipv4 traffic flows.
