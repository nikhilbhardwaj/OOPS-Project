Header files for the embedded wsola algorithm
	
wsola speeds up and slows down audio without altering the pitch.
these header files are whats required to embedd wsola into your audio
applications.

these header files allow wsola to be incorperated into embedded (or
normal) code base. this algorithm has a very small memory footprint
(tens of kilobytes) and allows it to be implemented on embedded
devices. it also has variable time scaling, allowing dynamic adjustment
of audio playback speed.

please see the package 'wsola' for more information.
