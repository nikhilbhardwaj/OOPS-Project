Managed caches of persistent information
	
the cache modules are designed to assist a developer in persisting
data for a specified period of time.  often these modules are used in
web applications to store data locally to save repeated and redundant
expensive calls to remote machines or databases.  people have also
been known to use cache::cache for its straightforward interface in
sharing data between runs of an application or invocations of a
cgi-style script or simply as an easy to use abstraction of the
filesystem or shared memory.
