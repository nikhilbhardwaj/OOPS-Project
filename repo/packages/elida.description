Pbuilder mail interface
	
elida accepts the url of a .dsc file from the subject of a email
message and downloads the rest of the files of the corresponding
debian source package. if there is a previous version in debian,
a diff between the old and new source packages is reported. it
then runs pbuilder, piuparts, and lintian. the reports are
compressed and emailed back to the user.
