Time tool for the blackbox/fluxbox window managers
	
bbtime is a blackbox tool to display the system time in your
blackbox slit. it can also display other times as an offset
of your local time in a menu.

note that you don't actually need blackbox or fluxbox for this program
to work, but it won't look as good in other window managers.
