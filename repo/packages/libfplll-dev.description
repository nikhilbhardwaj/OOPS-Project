A library for lll-reduction of euclidean lattices, development
	
fplll is a library for computing reduced (nearly orthogonal) bases
for euclidean lattices using the floating-point lll algorithm.

fplll contains multiple different implementations of the
floating-point lll reduction algorithm, offering multiple different
speed/guarantees ratios.

it contains a 'wrapper' that chooses the estimated best sequence of
variants in order to provide a guaranteed output as fast as possible.
in the case of the wrapper, the succession of variants is oblivious
to the user.

this package contains development files for libfplll.
