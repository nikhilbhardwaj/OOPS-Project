Perl interface to the graphviz graphing tool
	
this module provides an interface to layout and image generation of
directed and undirected graphs in a variety of formats (postscript,
png, etc.) using the "dot", "neato", "twopi", "circo" and "fdp"
programs from the graphviz project (http://www.graphviz.org/ or
http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/).
