Srs email address rewriting engine
	
libsrs2 is the next generation srs library. spf verifies that the
sender address of a mail matches (according to some policy) the
client ip address which submits the mail. when a mail is forwarded,
the sender address must be rewritten to comply with spf policy. the
sender rewriting scheme, or srs, provides a standard for this
rewriting which is not vulnerable to attacks by spammers.
