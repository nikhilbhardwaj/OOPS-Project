A small caching dns proxy and dhcp/tftp server
	
dnsmasq is a lightweight, easy to configure, dns forwarder and dhcp
server. it is designed to provide dns and optionally, dhcp, to a
small network. it can serve the names of local machines which are
not in the global dns. the dhcp server integrates with the dns
server and allows machines with dhcp-allocated addresses
to appear in the dns with names configured either in each host or
in a central configuration file. dnsmasq supports static and dynamic
dhcp leases and bootp/tftp for network booting of diskless machines.
