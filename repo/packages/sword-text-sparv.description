Spanish reina-valera bible (1909) for sword
	
the reina-valera bible (1909) is a spanish bible translation based on
the textus receptus.

this package requires a libsword version of at least 1.5.9 to access
through a sword front end.  however, this is not declared as a dependency
because you may have occasion to install just the text without any sort
of front end or other interface.
