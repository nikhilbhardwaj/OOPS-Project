Bitronix jta transaction manager
	
the bitronix transaction manager (btm) is a simple but complete implementation
of the jta 1.0.1b api. it is a fully working xa transaction manager that
provides all services required by the jta api while trying to keep the code as
simple as possible for easier understanding of the xa semantics. this is btm's
strongest point compared to its competitors: it is trivial to configure and
when something goes wrong it is much easier to figure out what to do thanks to
the great care placed in useful error reporting and logging.
