Use perl code in ocaml programs, development files
	
perl4caml allows you to use perl code within objective caml (ocaml),
thus neatly side-stepping the old problem with ocaml which was that it
lacked a comprehensive set of libraries. well now you can use any part
of cpan in your ocaml code.

this package provides the tools necessary to use perl4caml in your own
programs.  to get the documentation, please install libperl4caml-ocaml-doc.
