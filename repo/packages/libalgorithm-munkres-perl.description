Extension for munkres' solution to assignment problem
	
the algorithm::munkres module extends the solution of assignment problem
for square matrices to rectangular matrices by padding zeros. thus a
rectangular matrix is converted to square matrix by padding necessary zeros.

assignment problem: given n jobs, n workers and the time taken by
each worker to complete a job then how should the assignment of a
worker to a job be done, so as to minimize the time taken.
