Xmms2 - xml plug-in
	
xmms2 is a redesign of the xmms music player. it features a client-server
model, allowing multiple (even simultaneous!) user interfaces, both textual
and graphical. all common audio formats are supported using plug-ins. on top of
this, there is a flexible media library to organize your music.

this package allows xmms2 to read xml based formats. this package is used by
other plug-ins that implement support for specific xml formats like
xmms2-plugin-xspf and xmms2-plugin-rss.
