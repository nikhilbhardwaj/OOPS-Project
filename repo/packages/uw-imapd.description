electronic messages kept on a (possibly shared) mail server.

the uw (university of washington) imap toolkit provides the c-client
mail-handling library supporting various network transport methods,
file system storage formats, and authentication and authorization
methods.

this package contains imapd, an imap4rev1 server daemon which uses the
c-client library.
