Standard conformant json processor in java - api documentation
	
jackson is a java-based json-processing package that contains:


 * high-performance streaming json parser/generator
 * tree model that can be built from/written to parser/generator
 * object mapper that implements data binding to/from
 * parser/generator


api of streaming parser/generator is similar to stax api used for
efficient xml processing on java platform.

beyond very fast json parser and generator, jackson project also offers
full data binding support through 2 different approaches: "object
mapper" for full pojo to/from json data mapping (similar to jaxb2) and
"tree mapper" for something similar to dom and xpath.

this package contains the api documentation.
