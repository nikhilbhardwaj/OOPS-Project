Graphical hard disk health status notifier
	
a graphical notifier for smartmontools which attempts to show messages from
the smartd disk monitoring daemon to the user. currently only for gtk.

warning: this package is not a replacement for regular backups. it will _try_
to warn the user when smartd sends a disk health warning. but success is not
guaranteed. at best this package is an extra layer of protection.
