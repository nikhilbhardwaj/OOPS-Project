mu is a set of utilities to deal with maildirs, specifically,
indexing and searching.

 - mu index - recursively scans a collection of email messages, and

stores information found in a database.

 - mu find - searches for messages based on some search criteria.
 - mu mkmdir - creates a new maildir


mu uses libgmime2 to parse the message, and xapian to store the message data.
