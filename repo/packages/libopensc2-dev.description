Opensc development files
	
opensc provides a set of libraries and utilities to access smart
cards.  it mainly focuses on cards that support cryptographic
operations. it facilitates their use in security applications such as
mail encryption, authentication, and digital signature. opensc
implements the pkcs#11 api. applications supporting this api, such as
iceweasel and icedove, can use it. opensc implements the pkcs#15
standard and aims to be compatible with all software that does so as
well.

this package contains files necessary for developing applications
with the libopensc libraries from opensc.org.
