Dec os8 images for a pdp-8 emulator
	
this package contains images of the os8 operating system
which are usable by a pdp-8 emulator.

the debian simh package supplies a pdp8 emulator, but
the file are in a standard format usable by any other
pdp8 emulator such as jones's or haygood's emulator.

the os8 script will run the simh emulator
with these images.

these images are not dfsg free because dec prohibits
commercial use of these images.
