Set of metacity/gtk-2+ themes
	
shiki-colors is a set of metacity/gtk-2+ themes which mix the elegance of
a dark theme with the usability of a light theme, resulting in a hybrid theme.

this package provides seven variations of the shiki-colors (murrine) theme:

shiki-brave (blue), shiki-dust (chocolate), shiki-human (orange),
shiki-illustrious (pink),
shiki-noble (purple), shiki-wine (red), and shiki-wise (green)
