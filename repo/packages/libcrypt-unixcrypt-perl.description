Perl-only implementation of the crypt(3) function
	
the crypt::unixcrypt module is a portable implementation of the unix
library function crypt().  it is especially useful on systems whose
perl does not implement the built-in crypt() function.

this module won't overload a built-in crypt() unless forced by a true
value of the variable $crypt::unixcrypt::override_builtin.
