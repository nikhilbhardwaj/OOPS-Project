Image processing tools providing imagemagick interface
	
graphicsmagick provides a set of command-line applications to manipulate
image files. it is a fork of the imagemagick project and therefore offers
a similar set of features, but puts a larger emphasis on stability.

with this package installed, the graphicsmagick command line tools can
be executed like their imagemagick counterparts. it allows to migrate
scripts from imagemagick to graphicsmagick without any code changes.
