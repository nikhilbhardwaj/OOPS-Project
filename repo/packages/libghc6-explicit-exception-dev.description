Haskell exceptions which are explicit in the type signature
	
this package provides a library for the haskell programming language.
see http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on haskell.

this library provides synchronous and asynchronous exceptions which are
explicit in the type signature. the first ones are very similar to either
and control.monad.error.errort. the second ones are used for
system.io.readfile and system.io.hgetcontents.
