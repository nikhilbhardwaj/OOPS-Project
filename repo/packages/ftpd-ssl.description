Ftp server with ssl encryption support
	
this is the netkit ftp server with encryption support.

ftpd-ssl replaces normal ftpd using ssl authentication and encryption.
it interoperates with normal ftp.
it checks if the other side is also talking ssl, if not it falls back
to normal ftp protocol.

advantages over normal ftp(d): your passwords and the data you send
will not go in cleartext over the line. nobody can get it with
tcpdump or similar tools.
