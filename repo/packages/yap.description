The yap prolog system
	
yap is a high-performance prolog compiler developed at liacc/universidade
do porto and at coppe sistemas/ufrj. its prolog engine is based in the wam
(warren abstract machine), with several optimizations for better
performance. yap follows the edinburgh tradition, and is largely
compatible with the iso-prolog standard and with quintus and sicstus prolog.

yap features a constraint solver over real numbers, and support for
constraint handling rules (chr).
