Perl modules to treat hashes as objects, with arbitrary accessors/mutators
	
a hash::asobject is a blessed hash that provides read-write
access to its elements using accessors.  (actually, they're both accessors
and mutators.)

it's designed to act as much like a plain hash as possible; this means, for
example, that you can use methods like destroy to get or set hash elements
with that name.
