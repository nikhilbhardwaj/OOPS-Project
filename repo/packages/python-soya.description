High level 3d engine for python
	
soya 3d is a high level 3d engine for python. it relies on opengl and
sdl. it is designed with games in mind, and written partly in python
and partly in c; the goal is to provide a full architecture for making
free (gpl) games of professional quality entirely in python.
soya can also render on pygame surfaces !
