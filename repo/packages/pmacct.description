Promiscuous mode traffic accountant
	
pmacct is a tool designed to gather traffic information (bytes and number
of packets) by listening on a promiscuous interface or for netflow data,
which may facilitate billing, bandwidth management, traffic analysis, or
creating usage graphs.

data can be stored in memory and queried, displayed directly, or written
to a database; storage methods are quite flexible and may aggregate totals
or keep them separate.
