Moose extension to turn a class into a singleton
	
moosex::singleton lets you easily change your moose class into a singleton,
which is a class that only has one instance in an application. all you should
need to do is change your use of "use moose" to "use moosex::singleton". this
module uses a new class metaclass and instance metaclass, so if you're doing
metamagic you may not be able to use this.
