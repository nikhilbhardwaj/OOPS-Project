Cross-platform media decoding library
	
avbin is a thin wrapper around ffmpeg, providing binary compatibility
for applications and languages that need it.

ffmpeg is a collection of audio and video codecs widely used in
projects such as mplayer, xine, gstreamer and vlc. it is under
continuous development; so much so that its developers rarely provide
a release, and svn snapshots of the library must be statically linked
to avoid version incompatibilities.
