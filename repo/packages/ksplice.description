Patching live kernel without having to reboot
	
ksplice allows system administrators to apply security patches to the
linux kernel without having to reboot. ksplice takes as input a source
code change in unified diff format and the kernel source code to be
patched, and it applies the patch to the corresponding running kernel.
the running kernel does not need to have been prepared in advance in any
way.
