Enlightenment dr17 file chunk reading/writing utility
	
eet is a tiny library designed to write an arbitrary set of chunks of data to a
file and optionally compress each chunk (very much like a zip file) and allows
fast random-access reading of the file later on. it does not do zip as zip
itself has more complexity than needed, and it was much simpler to implement
this once here.

this package contains eet, an utility that allows you to extract, insert,
encode and decode config blobs created with libeet.
