Century-style font revival
	
this font is currently the closest to release, with a decent glyph complement.
it's a straightforward revival  of a somewhat forgotten, but handsome and
utilitarian, font from the atf collection. it's obviously very similar to the
familiar century oldstyle, but with more refined proportions and stroke. this
version is based on the 18pt from the 1923 catalog.
