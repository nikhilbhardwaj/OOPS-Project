Fullscreen postscript presentation tool
	
pspresent is a tool that displays postscript slides in fullscreen, for
giving presentations.  navigation is simple: spacebar goes forward one
slide, backspace takes you back one slide.  the escape key quits.  the
display itself is double-buffered giving seamless transitions between
slides.
