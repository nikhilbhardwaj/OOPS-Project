Tool that converts source archives into debian package source
	
this package allows you to take a standard (or upstream) source package
and convert it into a format that will allow you to build debian packages.

after answering a few questions, dh_make will then provide a set of
templates that, after some small editing, will allow you to create a
debian package.
