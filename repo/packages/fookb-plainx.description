An xkb state indicator -- plain x version.
	
windowmaker docked xkb state indicator. fookb can switch xkb groups
and display a pixmap corresponding to the selected group. it also can
execute a specified command upon the switch (for example, play sound).
this is the plain x-compiled version. it can't do docking, and uses
only x resources for configuration.
