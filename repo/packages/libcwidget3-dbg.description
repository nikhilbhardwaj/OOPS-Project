High-level terminal interface library for c++ (debugging files)
	
libcwidget is a modern user interface library modeled on gtk+ and qt,
but using curses as its display layer and with widgets that are
tailored to a terminal environment.

this package contains debugging symbols for libcwidget-dbg.  it is
only needed if you want to generate useful backtraces for programs
using cwidget.
