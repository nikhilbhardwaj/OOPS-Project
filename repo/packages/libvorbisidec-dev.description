Integer-only ogg vorbis decoder, aka "tremor" (development files)
	
libvorbisidec is an ogg vorbis audio decoder (also known as
"tremor"), implemented with no floating point arithmetic.  this makes
it particularly amenable to use on systems which lack floating point
hardware.

this package contains the development files.
