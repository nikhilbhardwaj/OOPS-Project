Object-oriented vector math methods in perl
	
this module was adapted from math::vector, written by wayne m. syvinski.

it uses most of the same algorithms, and currently preserves the same
names as the original functions, though some aliases have been added to
make the interface more natural (at least to the way i think.)

the "object" for the object oriented calling style is a blessed array
reference which contains a vector of the form [x,y,z].  methods will
typically return a list.
