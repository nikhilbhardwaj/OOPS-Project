Library for managing ocaml libraries (development files)
	
the "findlib" ocaml library provides a scheme to manage reusable
software components (packages), and includes tools that support this
scheme. packages are collections of ocaml modules for which
metainformation can be stored. the packages are kept in the
filesystem hierarchy, but with strict directory structure. the
library contains functions to look the directory up that stores a
package, to query metainformation about a package, and to retrieve
dependency information about multiple packages.

this package contains development files needed to compile programs
using findlib.
