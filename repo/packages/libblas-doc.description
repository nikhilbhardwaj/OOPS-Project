Basic linear algebra subroutines 3, documentation
	
blas (basic linear algebra subroutines) is a set of efficient
routines for most of the basic vector and matrix operations.
they are widely used as the basis for other high quality linear
algebra software, for example lapack and linpack.  this
implementation is the fortran 77 reference implementation found
at netlib.

this package contains manual pages for the routines, and other
supporting documentation
