Radius protocol proxy supporting radsec
	
a generic radius proxy that in addition to usual radius udp transport also
supports tls (radsec). it aims to be flexible while at the same time small in
size and memory footprint, efficient and easy to configure.

it can be useful as a proxy on site boundaries or in other complex radius
routing topologies. it supports both ipv4 and ipv6.
