Graphical player for interactive fiction games
	
gargoyle is an interactive fiction (text adventure) player that
supports all the major interactive fiction formats.

most interactive fiction is distributed as portable game files. these
portable game files come in many formats. in the past, you used to
have to download a separate player (interpreter) for each format of
if you wanted to play. instead, gargoyle provides unified player.

gargoyle is based on the standard interpreters for the formats it
supports: .taf (adrift games, played with scare), .dat (advsys),
*.agx/.d$$ (agility), .asl/.cas (quest games, played with geas),
*.jacl/.j2 (jacl), .l9/.sna (level 9), .mag (magnetic), .gam/.t3
(tads), .z1/.z2/.z3/.z4/.z5/.z6/.z7/.z8 (inform z-machine games,
played with frotz or nitfol), .ulx/.blb/.blorb/.glb/.gblorb (inform
or supergl√∫s games compiled to the glulxe vm in blorb archives,
played with git or glulxe), .zlb, .zblorb (inform z-machine games in
blorb archives, played with frotz).

(note: do not confuse the git glux interpreter with the git dvcs or
the gnu interactive tools)

gargoyle also features graphics, sounds and unicode support.

technically all the bundled interpreters support the glk api to
manage i/o (keyboard, graphics, sounds, file) in if games. gargoyle
provides a glk implementation called garglk that displays texts and
images in a graphical gtk window, with care on typography.

limitations:

* this free version of gargoyle does not include the non-free alan
and hugo interpreter (and use a different, free monospace font).

* while gargoyle can display in-game pictures, it does not provide a
way to display the cover art present in some blorb archives.

* the tads interpreter doesn't support html tads; you can play
the games, but will miss the hyperlinks.
