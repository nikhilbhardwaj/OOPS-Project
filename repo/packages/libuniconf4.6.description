uniconf is a configuration system that can serve as the centrepiece among
many other, existing configuration systems, such as:

 * gconf
 * kconfig
 * windows registry
 * mutt ;)


uniconf can also be accessed over the network, with authentication, allowing
easy replication of configuration data via the unireplicategen.
