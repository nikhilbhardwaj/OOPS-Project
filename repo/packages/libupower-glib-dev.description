Abstraction for power management - development files
	
upower provides an interface to enumerate power sources on the system
and control system-wide power management. any application can access the
org.freedesktop.upower service on the system message bus. some
operations (such as suspending the system) are restricted using policykit.

this package contains files that are needed to build applications.
