Gravitation simulation of planetary bodies
	
planets is a simple interactive program for playing with simulations
of planetary systems. it is great for teaching gravitation on planet
level.

the user interface is aimed at being simple enough for a fairly young
kid to enjoy it (it has a special kid-mode for this purpose).
