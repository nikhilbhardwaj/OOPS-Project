Tunnel tcp connections through http proxies
	
corkscrew is a simple tool to tunnel tcp connections through an http
proxy supporting the connect method. it reads stdin and writes to
stdout during the connection, just like netcat.

it can be used for instance to connect to an ssh server running on
a remote 443 port through a strict https proxy.
