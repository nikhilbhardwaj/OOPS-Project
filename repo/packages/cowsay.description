A configurable talking cow
	
cowsay (or cowthink) will turn text into happy ascii cows, with
speech (or thought) balloons. if you don't like cows, ascii art is
available to replace it with some other creatures (tux, the bsd
daemon, dragons, and a plethora of animals, from a turkey to
an elephant in a snake).
