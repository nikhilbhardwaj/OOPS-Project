Hp postscript printer definition (ppd) files
	
because postscript is just a page description language,
there is a need to provide a mechanism for a print spooler to
customize the postscript job to the actual printer device.

a ppd (postscript printer definitions) specify the device specific
postscript commands needed to utilize printer features (such as
printing quality, paper tray, duplex printing).

this package contains some ppds for hp printers that are not in
package linuxprinting.org-ppds
