Package for nano-scale material simulations
	
openmx (open source package for material explorer) is a program package for
nano-scale material simulations based on density functional theories (dft),
norm-conserving pseudopotentials and pseudo-atomic localized
basis functions. since the code is designed for the realization of
large-scale ab initio calculations on parallel computers, it is anticipated
that openmx can be a useful and powerful tool for nano-scale material sciences
in a wide variety of systems such as biomaterials, carbon nanotubes, magnetic
materials, and nanoscale conductors.
