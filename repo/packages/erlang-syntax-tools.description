Erlang/otp modules for handling abstract erlang syntax trees
	
syntax_tools contains modules for handling abstract erlang syntax
trees in a way that is compatible with the "parse trees" of the
stdlib module erl_parse, together with utilities for reading source
files in unusual ways and pretty-printing syntax trees. also it
includes a module merger and renamer called igor, as well as an
automatic code-cleaner.
