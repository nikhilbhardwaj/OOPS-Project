Metapackage for open font design
	
all the tools you need to design, adapt, improve and hack on open fonts,
including recommendations for the ones needed to do font design in a
collaborative manner using vcs (version control systems).

a growing number of high-quality fonts are released under the open font
license (or similar recognized font-specific licenses) to allow distributing,
modifying, improving and branching by others including adding new glyphs and
smart behaviours, extending the unicode coverage, improving hinting and
allowing new languages to be supported on the free desktop and, of course,
fixing bugs.

the various ofl'ed fonts are listed at http://scripts.sil.org/ofl_fonts and at
http://unifont.org/fontguide
