Basic linear algebra comm. subprograms - test files for mpi
	
the blacs project is an ongoing investigation whose purpose is to
create a linear algebra oriented message passing interface that may be
implemented efficiently and uniformly across a large range of
distributed memory platforms.

you can choose between an implementation based on mpi or pvm. this package
uses mpi. there are packages for the shared libraries, for the static
libraries and the development files, and for test programs (this one).

most users do not need to install this package directly because it contains
test programs for the blacs libraries. you only need these if you experience
problems with scalapack. the blacs libraries are used as a high level
communications library for scalapack. scalapack is a parallel version of
lapack and is used on beowulf type clusters.
