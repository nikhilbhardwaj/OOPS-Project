Secure encryption and decryption of files and streams
	
ccrypt is a utility for encrypting and decrypting files and streams. it was
designed as a replacement for the standard unix crypt utility, which is
notorious for using a very weak encryption algorithm. ccrypt is based on the
rijndael cipher, which is the u.s. government's chosen candidate for the
advanced encryption standard (aes, see http://www.nist.gov/aes). this cipher is
believed to provide very strong security.
