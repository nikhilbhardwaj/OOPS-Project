Prompt user for a password
	
this module lets you ask the user for a password in the
traditional way, from the keyboard, without echoing.

the read_password function prompts for input, reads a line of
text from the keyboard, then returns that line to the caller.
the line of text doesn't include the newline character, so
there's no need to use chomp.
