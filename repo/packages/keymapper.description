Keyboard map decision tree builder and interpreter
	
this package implements an alternate way to let a user decide which
keyboard map to use. it generates a decision tree and then asks the
user to press a couple of keys. depending on which keycode is returned,
the list of possible keyboards is pruned until there is only one left.
