Server that manages uniconf elements
	
uniconf is a configuration system that can serve as the centrepiece among
many other, existing configuration systems.

uniconf can also be accessed over the network, with authentication, allowing
easy replication of configuration data via the unireplicategen.

this package contains the server that accepts incoming tcp or unix
connections, and gets or sets uniconf elements at the request of a
uniconf client.
