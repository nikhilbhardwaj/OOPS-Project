Shared perl library
	
this package is required by programs which embed a perl interpreter to
ensure that the correct version of `perl-base' is installed.  it
additionally contains the shared perl library on architectures where the
perl binary is linked to libperl.a (currently only i386, for performance
reasons).  in other cases the actual library is in the `perl-base' package.
