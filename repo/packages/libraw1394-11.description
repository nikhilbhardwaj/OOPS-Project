Library for direct access to ieee 1394 bus (aka firewire)
	
libraw1394 is the only supported interface to the kernel side raw1394
of the linux ieee-1394 subsystem, which provides direct access to the
connected 1394 buses to user space.  through libraw1394/raw1394,
applications can directly send to and receive from other nodes without
requiring a kernel driver for the protocol in question.
