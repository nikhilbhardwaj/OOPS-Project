Kernel time variables configuration utility
	
this package provides a utility to manipulate the kernel time
variables.  for a machine connected to the internet, or equipped with
a precision oscillator or radio clock, the best way to keep the
system clock accurate is using ntp (network time protocol).  however,
for a standalone or intermittently connected machine, you may use
adjtimex instead to at least correct for systematic drift.  it can
optionally adjust the system clock using the cmos clock as a
reference, and can log times for long-term estimation of drift rates.
