Panorama tools library
	
this package contains the panoramatools library. it provides basic
algorithmic tools to generate, edit and transform many kinds of
panoramic images.

panorama tools was originally created by professor helmut dersch of the
university of applied sciences furtwangen. professor dersch's site no
longer has links to download the tools, which is why this panotools
sourceforge project exists.
