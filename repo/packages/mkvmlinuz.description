Create a kernel to boot a powerpc machine from open firmware
	
this little program takes a powerpc linux kernel as an uncompressed
elf image file (usually called vmlinux or such) and adds boot code
and possibly a ramdisk to create a compressed kernel image that
can be booted directly from open firmware, thus eliminating the
need for a second-stage bootloader such as yaboot or quik. this is
especially useful on powerpc sub-architectures which do not have a
bootloader at all, but may also come in handy for install kernels,
netboot systems, and the like.
