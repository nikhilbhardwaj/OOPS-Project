The gnu java bytecode interpreter (transitional package)
	
gij is not limited to interpreting bytecode. it includes a class loader which
can dynamically load shared objects, so it is possible to give it the name
of a class which has been compiled and put into a shared library on the
class path.

this is a transitional package. it can be removed.
