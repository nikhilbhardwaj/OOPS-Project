Client-side bypassing of ngroups limitation in nfs protocol
	
this package contains a patch to the linux kernel, which allows to
bypass a limitation in the nfs/rpc protocol, which limits the number
of groups per users to 16 (whereas the linux kernel allows 32 groups
per users by default).

this is a linux nfs client patch. it works with every nfs server, by
identifying the necessary groups to advertise to the server.
