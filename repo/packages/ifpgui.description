Qt based manager for iriver ifp audio players
	
this project is an open-source graphical user interface (gui)
for iriver's ifp flash audio players.  it uses libifp to access
the player over the management interface.

this program does not work with the h, t or other recent models.
these models are known to work: ifp-1xx,3xx,5xx,7xx,8xx,9xx and n10.
you can only use this software if your player has the "management"
version of iriver's firmware installed.
