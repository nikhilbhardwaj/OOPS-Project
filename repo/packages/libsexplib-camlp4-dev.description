Automated conversions between ocaml-values and s-expressions
	
sexplib library contains functionality for parsing and pretty-printing
s-expressions.

sexplib also contains a preprocessing module for camlp4, which can be
used to automatically generate code from type definitions for
efficiently converting ocaml-values to s-expressions and vice versa.
in combination with the parsing and pretty-printing functionality this
frees users from having to write their own i/o-routines for the
datastructures they define.  possible errors during automatic
conversions from s-expressions to ocaml-values are reported in a very
human-readable way.

another module contained in sexplib you to extract and replace
sub-expressions in s-expressions.
