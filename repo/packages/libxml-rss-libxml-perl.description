Create and update rss files using xml::libxml
	
xml::rss::libxml uses xml::libxml (libxml2) for parsing rss instead of
xml::rss' xml::parser (expat), while trying to keep interface compatibility
with xml::rss.

xml::rss is an extremely handy tool, but it is unfortunately not exactly
the most lean or efficient rss parser, especially in a long-running process.

use this module when you have severe performance requirements working with rss
files.
