Flow-based network traffic analyser
	
softflowd is a flow-based network traffic anaylser capable of cisco
netflow data export. softflowd semi-statefully tracks traffic
flows recorded by listening on a network interface or by reading a
packet capture file. these flows may be reported via netflow to a
collecting host or summarised within softflowd itself.
