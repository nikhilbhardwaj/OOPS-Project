Gnu r package for xml parsing and generation
	
this package provides facilities for the r language to


 * parse xml files, urls and strings, using either the dom (document
   object model)/tree-based approach, or the event-driven sax (simple
   api for xml) mechanism;
 * generate xml content to buffers, files, urls, and internal xml trees;
 * read dtds as r objects.
