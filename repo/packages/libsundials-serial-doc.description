Sundials documentation files
	
the family of solvers referred to as sundials (suit of nonlinear and
differential/algebraic equation solvers) consists of solvers cvode
(for ode systems), cvodes (ode with sensitivity analysis capabilities),
ida (for differential-algebraic systems), and kinsol (for nonlinear
algebraic systems).

this package contains sundials documentation.
