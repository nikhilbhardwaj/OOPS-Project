Read-only access to unix mailboxes
	
mail::mboxparser attempts to provide a simplified access to standard
unix-mailboxes.  it offers only a subset of methods to get 'straight
to the point'. more sophisticated things can still be done by
invoking any method from mime::tools on the appropriate return
values.
