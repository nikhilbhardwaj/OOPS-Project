A pam module to move a user session into a cgroup
	
control groups provide a mechanism for aggregating/partitioning sets of tasks,
and all their future children, into hierarchical groups with specialized
behaviour.

this pam module will move a user session into an existing cgroup by attempting
to match uid and gid against the defined cgroup rules configuration.
