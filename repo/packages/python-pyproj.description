Python interface to proj.4 library
	
proj.4 performs cartographic transformations between geographic (lat/lon)
and map projection (x/y) coordinates. it can also transform directly
from one map projection coordinate system to another.

this is a python binding to proj.4, it can receive coordinates as numpy
arrays, python arrays, lists or scalars. this module is optimized for
numpy arrays.
