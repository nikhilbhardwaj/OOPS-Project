Bookmarks and browsing for the cd command
	
cdargs is a tool which enhances the navigation of the common unix file-system
inside the shell. it plugs into the shell built-in cd-command (via a shell
function or an  alias) and adds bookmarks and a browser to it.

it enables you to move to a very distant place in the file-system with just a
few keystrokes.
