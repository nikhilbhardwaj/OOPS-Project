Python bindings for liblinear
	
liblinear is a library for learning linear classifiers for large scale
applications. it supports support vector machines (svm) with l2 and l1
loss, logistic regression, multi class classification and also linear
programming machines (l1-regularized svms). its computational complexity
scales linearly with the number of training examples making it one of
the fastest svm solvers around. it also provides python bindings.

this package contains the python bindings.
