Dynamic universal music bibliotheque
	
dumb is a tracker library with support for it, xm, s3m and mod files. it
targets maximum accuracy to the original formats, with low-pass resonant
filters for the it files, accurate timing and pitching, and three resampling
quality settings (aliasing, linear interpolation and cubic interpolation).

this package contains the libdumb1 runtime library, a standalone library
for module playback. if you plan to use the allegro library with your
project, please consider the libaldmb1 library.
