Perl module providing authentication using the bitcard service
	
authen::bitcard is an implementation of verification for signatures generated
by bitcard authentication. for information on the bitcard protocol and using
bitcard in other applications, see <url:http://www.bitcard.org/api>

the module and the protocol are heavily based on authen::typekey. (in fact,
the bitcard authentication server also supports the typekey api!)
