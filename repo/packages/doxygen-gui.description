doxygen is a documentation system for c, c++, java, objective-c, python, idl
and to some extent php, c#, and d.  it can generate an on-line class browser
(in html) and/or an off-line reference manual (in latex) from a set of
documented source files. there is also support for generating man pages
and for converting the generated output into postscript, hyperlinked pdf
or compressed html.  the documentation is extracted directly from the sources.

this package contains doxywizard, a gui configuration tool for doxygen.
