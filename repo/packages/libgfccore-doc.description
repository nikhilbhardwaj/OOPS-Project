Gtk+ foundation classes core - api reference documentation
	
gtk+ foundation classes (gfc) is a set of integrated c++ foundation classes for
developing gtk+ applications.

gfc-core is a collection of c++ modules that form the core of the gfc library
upon which other modules, such as gfc-ui, are built.

gfc-core modules include a c++ wrapper for glib, a utf8 string class,
automatic memory management, a typesafe c++ signal and slots system.

this package provides the documentation of the gfc-core api.
