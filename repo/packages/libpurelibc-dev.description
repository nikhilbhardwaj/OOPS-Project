Development files for the purelibc library
	
purelibc is an overlay library that converts the glibc, the gnu standard c
library, into a pure library, i.e. a library that can upcall instead of
running the system calls. with purelibc a process can trace (and virtualize)
its own calls. it is used, for instance, by the umview modules to support
the recursion of virtual environments.

purelibc, along with umview, is part of the view-os project:
http://wiki.virtualsquare.org

this package contains the files needed to compile applications that link
purelibc.
