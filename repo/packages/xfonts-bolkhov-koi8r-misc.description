Character-cell koi8-r encoded cyrillic fonts for x (cyr-rfx collection)
	
this package provides a standard set of character-cell low-resolution
cyrillic fonts.  these are koi8-r fonts.
in most cases it is desirable to have the x font server (xfs) and/or
an x server installed to make the fonts available to x clients.

the fonts are modified (mainly with cyrillic added) versions of the
standard x-window fonts from misc/.  upstream author: dmitry
