Xprint job utility client library (development files)
	
libxprintapputil provides utility xpau apis allowing client applications
to access information about and control xprint jobs from an xprint server.

if you want to write an app to create xprint jobs (printing x windows
to paper, for instance) then you probably want libxp-dev instead.

this package provides a static library and c header files.
