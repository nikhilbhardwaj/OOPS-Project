Getty replacement - one single daemon for all consoles
	
ngetty is a daemon that starts login sessions on virtual console
terminals, on demand.  it is a good replacement for all those getty
processes started from init that, most of the time, are only taking up
memory.  when compiled statically with dietlibc, the ngetty binary size
is only about 2k and uses considerably less memory than a getty.
