Ocaml lexer generator with unicode support
	
ulex is a lexer generator for the objective caml (ocaml) programming
language.

it is implemented as a camlp4 syntax extension: lexer specifications
are embedded in regular ocaml code.

generated lexers work with a new kind of "lexbuf" that supports
unicode; a single lexer can work with arbitrary encodings of the input
stream.
