Compatibility with haskell 98
	
this package provides compatibility with the modules of haskell
98 and the ffi addendum, by means of wrappers around modules from
the base package (which in many cases have additional features).
however prelude, numeric and foreign are provided directly by
the base package.

this is the version bundled with the interpreter.
