Python-based software project scripting tool along the lines of make or rake
	
paver is a python-based software project scripting tool along the
lines of make or rake. it is not designed to handle the dependency
tracking requirements of, for example, a c program. it is designed to
help out with all of your other repetitive tasks (run documentation
generators, moving files about, downloading things), all with the
convenience of python's syntax and massive library of code.
