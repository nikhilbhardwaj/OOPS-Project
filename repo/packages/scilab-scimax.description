Symbolic computations for scilab based on maxima
	
this toolbox is providing symbolic capabilities with the scilab languages.

it is based on maxima which is a fully symbolic computation program.
it is full featured doing symbolic manipulation of polynomials, matrices,
rational functions, integration, todd-coxeter methods for finite group
analysis, graphing, multiple precision floating point computation.
