Copy-on-write directory tree utility.
	
tries to make copy-on-write semantics upon hard-link copied
directory trees generated with 'cp -la'

'cow-shell' command invokes a shell session. within that session,
under the directory cow-shell was invoked,
cowdancer will create a new file when existing i-nodes are opened for
write.
useful for quick scratch workspace and experimentation.

for a useful debian tool, try cowbuilder.
