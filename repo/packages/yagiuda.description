Software to analyse performance of yagi-uda antennas
	
you give the dimensions and positions of each element, and the
program calculates gain, input impedance, front-to back ratio,
beam-patterns etc. an optimisation program 'optimise' tries to
optimise a design. the optimiser can also tell you the sensitivity
of a good design, to small mechanical errors.
