Red hat cluster suite - cluster configuration module
	
this package is part of the red hat cluster suite, a complete
high-availability solution.

the ccs library provides a simplified xpath implementation to access
cman/corosync configuration data via the same api as the old and
deprecated libccs provided by ccsd.

this module implements a perl interface to the libccs library.
it shouldn't be used for new development. use libconfdb from
corosync instead.
