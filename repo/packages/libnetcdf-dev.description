Development kit for netcdf
	
netcdf (network common data form) is an interface for scientific
data access and a freely-distributed software library that provides an
implementation of the interface.  the netcdf library also defines a
machine-independent format for representing scientific data.
together, the interface, library, and format support the creation,
access, and sharing of scientific data.

this package includes everything needed for developing in c, c++,
fortran 77, and fortran 90.
