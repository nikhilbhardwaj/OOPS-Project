Forks and watches multiple instances of a program
	

multiwatch forks multiple instance of one application and
keeps them running; it is made to be used with spawn-fcgi
so all forks share the same fastcgi socket (no webserver
restart needed if you increase/decrease the number of forks),
and it is easier than to setup multiple daemontool or runit
supervised instances.
