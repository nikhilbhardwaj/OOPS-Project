Show where your diskspace is being used
	
filelight allows you to understand your disk usage by graphically
representing your filesystem as a set of concentric, segmented rings.

it is like a pie-chart, but the segments nest, allowing you to see both
which directories take up all your space, and which directories
and files inside those directories are the real culprits.
