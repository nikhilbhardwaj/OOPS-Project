Find uris in arbitrary text
	
this module does one thing: finds uris and urls in plain text.  it finds
them quickly and it finds them all (or what uri::url considers a uri
to be.)  it only finds uris which include a scheme (http:// or the
like); for something a bit less strict have a look at
uri::find::schemeless.
