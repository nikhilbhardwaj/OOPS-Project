cgi:irc is a perl/cgi program that allows you to use irc
from a web browser without having to have access to an
irc port. it does not use java, but it does need a browser
capable of rendering frames. it can be used on a web page
to allow users to chat and can also be used to access chat
from behind a firewall.
