Ms exchange rvp instant messaging plugin for gaim - transitional
	
librvp is a plugin for gaim which implements the rvp protocol
used by microsoft exchange and its windows messenger client.

this is not an msn messenger protocol plugin; for that, see the
main gaim package.

this package has been superseded by pidgin-librvp, and can be safely removed.
