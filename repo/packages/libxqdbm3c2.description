Qdbm database libraries for c++ [runtime]
	
qdbm is an embeded database library compatible with gdbm and ndbm.
it features hash database and b+ tree database and is developed referring
to gdbm for the purpose of the following three points: higher processing
speed, smaller size of a database file, and simpler api.
this is the runtime package for programs that use the dqbm
database library.  this is only for programs which use the c++ interface.
