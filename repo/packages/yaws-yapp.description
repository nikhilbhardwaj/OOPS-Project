An easy way to deploy applications for yaws web server
	
yaws-yapp (yaws application handler) is a helper application.
it takes care of adding, and removing, the applications into a running
server. when anyone access the server with an url that matches the path
for an added application, the docroot will be temporarily switched
to where the web pages for that application are located.
