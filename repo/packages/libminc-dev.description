Mni medical image format development environment
	
this package contains the library and headers for libminc2 and
libvolume_io2.

the minc file format is a highly flexible medical image file format.
minc version 1 is built on top of the netcdf generalized data format.
minc version 2 is built on top of the hdf data format.  this library
handles both formats.  in each case the format is
simple, self-describing, extensible, portable and n-dimensional, with
programming interfaces for both low-level data access and high-level
volume manipulation. on top of the libraries is a suite of generic
image-file manipulation tools. the format, libraries and tools are
designed for use in a medical-imaging research environment : they are
simple and powerful and make no attempt to provide a pretty interface
to users.
