Locate updated language files in emdebian
	
emdebian separates translations from each package to reduce the
amount of required installation space. as packages are updated,
new translations may be added as well as new packages.

langupdate checks the list of installed packages, calculates
the availability of translations for your locale, checks
which translations are already installed and installs any
suitable translation packages.

langupdate does nothing if only debian packages are installed.
