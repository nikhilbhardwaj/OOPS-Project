fop is a print formatter driven by xsl formatting objects.
it is a java application that reads a formatting object
tree and then turns it into a pdf document. the formatting
object tree can be in the form of an xml document (output by
an xslt engine like xalan) or can be passed in memory as a dom
document or (in the case of xalan) sax events.
