System tool to enable or disable system services
	
chkconfig is a utility to update and query runlevel information for system
services.  chkconfig manipulates the numerous symbolic links in /etc/init.d/,
to relieve system administrators of some of the drudgery of manually editing
the symbolic links.

in debian, there are several tools with similar functionality, but users
coming from other linux distributions will find the tools in this package
more familiar.
