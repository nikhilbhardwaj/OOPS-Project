Perl module to read mail from a folder
	
email::folder is a perl module which reads all messages from a folder into
email::simple objects (see libemail-simple-perl for more), making them easy
to manipulate from perl. it becomes fairly trivial to extract information
from headers in your mail, or change them to different values. as a result,
this provides a general purpose mail handling facility.
