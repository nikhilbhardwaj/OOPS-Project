Translation of the nec2 fortran source code to the c language
	
the translation was performed mostly "by hand" and a lot of modifications
to the original program were introduced in order to modernize the nec2
and to remove as many built-in limitations as possible. the attendant
somnec program was also translated to c and incorporated in nec2c as a
function so that sommerfeld ground solutions are a part of the program.
