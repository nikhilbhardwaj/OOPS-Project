The gpl ghostscript postscript/pdf interpreter - documentation
	
ghostscript is used for postscript/pdf preview and printing.  usually as
a back-end to a program such as ghostview, it can display postscript and pdf
documents in an x11 environment.

this package contains the documentation of ghostscript. as this documentation
is only interesting for printer driver developers or advanced users, it is
in this separate package which can be left out in space-restricted
installations, like for example live cds.
