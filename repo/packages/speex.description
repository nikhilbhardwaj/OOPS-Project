The speex codec command line tools
	
speex is an audio codec especially designed for compressing voice at low
bit-rates for applications such as voice over ip (voip). in some senses,
it is meant to be complementary to the vorbis codec which places a greater
emphasis on high-quality music reproduction.

this package contains the encoder and decoder command-line applications.
