elfutils is a collection of utilities, including eu-ld (a linker),
eu-nm (for listing symbols from object files), eu-size (for listing the
section sizes of an object or archive file), eu-strip (for discarding
symbols), eu-readelf (to see the raw elf file structures), and eu-elflint
(to check for well-formed elf files).
