Text-wrapping library with i18n - development files
	
text-wrapping (or line-folding) library for displaying a string on
the terminal.  this supports i18n (internationalization), i.e,
automatic locale-encoding detection, multibyte encoding (such as
utf-8, euc-jp, and so on), fullwidth characters (occupying two
columns per one character, like cjk ideogram), combining characters
(occupying zero columns per one character, like thai and diacritical
marks), and languages which do not use whitespaces between words
(like chinese and japanese).

this package contains files needed for development using this
library.
