Superior lisp interaction mode for emacs (lisp-side server)
	
slime is the superior lisp interaction mode for emacs.

this is an ilisp-like development environment intended for maximum
integration with cmucl (also works with sbcl, openmcl and work is
ongoing on lispworks and current cvs version of clisp and clisp 2.32
on linux).

this package contains the lisp-side server, needed by the emacs client
(see package slime).
