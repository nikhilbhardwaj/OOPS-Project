An utility for directing compilation.
	
gnu make is an utility which controls the generation of executables and
other target files of a program from the program's source files. it
determines automatically which pieces of a large program need to be
(re)created, and issues the commands to (re)create them. make is not
limited to programs and executable, it can be applied to any task
where a set of target files must be created based on a set of input
files, based on dependency and processing rules. indeed, make is a
general purpose dependency solver.
