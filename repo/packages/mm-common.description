Common build files of the gnome c++ bindings
	
the mm-common module provides the build infrastructure and utilities
shared among the gnome c++ binding libraries.  it is only a required
dependency for building the c++ bindings from the gnome.org version
control repository.  an installation of mm-common is not required for
building tarball releases, unless configured to use maintainer-mode.

the mm-common package also includes a snapshot of the doxygen tag file
for the gnu c++ library reference documentation.
