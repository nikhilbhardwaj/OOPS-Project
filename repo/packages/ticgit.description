Ticketing system built on git
	
ticgit is an issue tracking system based in the git revision control
system. tickets are stored in a separate branch called “ticgit” within
a git repository that can be made available on a public server along
with the project’s source code. the idea is to keep tickets close to a
project without touching its source tree.
