Tex equations in html documents
	
provides a method of including mathematics in html pages that works
across multiple browsers under windows, macintosh os x, linux and
other flavors of unix. it overcomes a number of the shortcomings of
the traditional method of using images to represent mathematics:
jsmath uses native fonts, so they resize when you change the size of
the text in your browser, they print at the full resolution of your
printer, and you don't have to wait for dozens of images to be
downloaded in order to see the mathematics in a web page.
