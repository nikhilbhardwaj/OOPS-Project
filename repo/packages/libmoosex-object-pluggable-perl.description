Perl module for adding plugin support to your moose classes
	
moosex::object::pluggable is meant to be loaded as a role from moose-based
classes it will add five methods and four attributes to assist you with the
loading and handling of plugins and extensions for plugins. i understand that
this may pollute your namespace, however i took great care in using the least
ambiguous names possible.
