Clone of scorched earth
	
xscorch is a clone of the classic dos game, "scorched earth". the basic goal
is to annihilate enemy tanks using overpowered guns :).  basically, you buy
weapons, you target the enemy by adjusting the angle of your turret and
firing power, and you hope to destroy their tank before they destroy yours.
