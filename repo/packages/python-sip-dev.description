Python/c++ bindings generator development files
	
sip is a tool for generating bindings for c++ classes with some ideas
borrowed from swig, but capable of tighter bindings because of its
specificity towards c++ and python.

sip was originally designed to generate python bindings for kde and so
has explicit support for the signal slot mechanism used by the qt/kde
class libraries.

features:

    - connecting qt signals to python functions and class methods
    - connecting python signals to qt slots
    - overloading virtual member functions with python class methods
    - protected member functions
    - abstract classes
    - enumerated types
    - global class instances
    - static member functions.


this package contains the code generator tool and the development headers
needed to develop python bindings with sip.
