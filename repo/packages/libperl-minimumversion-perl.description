Module to determine minimum required version of perl required
	
perl::minimumversion is a module that inspects arbitrary perl source code and
determines the minimum version of perl required to be able to run it. because
it is based on ppi, it can do this without having to actually load the code.

currently it tests both the syntax of your code, and the use of explicit
version dependencies such as "require 5.005".

future plans are to also add support for tracing module dependencies.
