Secure display manager - secure remote access to x11
	
sdm is an x11 display manager similar to xdm, gdm and kdm, but unlike
those it wraps the x11 traffic within an ssh tunnel to provide a secure
login mechanism for remote x sessions.
sdm provides access only through ssh, not locally. it is technically
possible to access an sdm server from same host, but probably a waste of
cpu power.

this package should be installed on any server acting as sdm server.
