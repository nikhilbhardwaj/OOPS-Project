Design-by-contract oo in perl
	
the class::contract module implements strong encapsulation, static
inheritance, and design-by-contract condition checking for
object-oriented perl. the module provides a declarative syntax for
attribute, method, constructor, and destructor definitions at both
the object and class level. pre-conditions, post-conditions, and
class invariants are also fully supported.
