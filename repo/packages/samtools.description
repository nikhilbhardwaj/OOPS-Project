Processing sequence alignments in sam and bam formats
	
samtools is a set of utilities that manipulate nucleotide sequence alignments
in the binary bam format. it imports from and exports to the ascii sam
(sequence alignment/map) format, does sorting, merging and indexing, and allows
to retrieve reads in any regions swiftly. it is designed to work on a stream,
and is able to open a bam (not sam) file on a remote ftp or http server.
