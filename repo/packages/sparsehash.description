Memory-efficient c++ hash_map implementation (transition package)
	
the google sparsehash project contains several c++ template hash-map
implementations in use at google, with different performance
characteristics, including an implementation that optimizes for space
and one that optimizes for speed.

this is a transitional package that simply depends on the new
libsparsehash-dev.  it can be safeley removed.
