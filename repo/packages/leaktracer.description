Simple and efficient memory-leak tracer for c++ programs
	
leaktracer traces calls to new and delete, and reports
inconsistencies in the c++-level memory-management.

it has limitations (eg. when you override the new and delete
operators yourself), but is very easy to use (eg. compared to more
complete tools like mpatrol), traces the c++ level (unlike most other
tools), and gives pretty good results.

it uses gdb to display source-file information.
