Lists windows and kills errant programs
	
gpe-taskmanager is part of the gpe palmtop environment. it displays a list of
windows on the current display, and allows the user to kill the task which
owns a particular window. this can be helpful if a program has hung and is no
longer responding to direct user actions.
