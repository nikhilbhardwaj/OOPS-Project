Library to support merb-slices application modularization
	
usually these slices are reusable extractions from the main application.
a module is set up to serve as a namespace for controller, models, helpers,
etc.

this package is a dependency package, which depends on the package
containing actual ruby merb-slices libraries for the default ruby version
(currently 1.8).
