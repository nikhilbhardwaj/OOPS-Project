Virtual distributed ethernet - cryptcab
	
vde is a virtual switch that can connect multiple virtual machines together,
both local and remote.

components of the vde architecture are vde switches (virtual counterpart of
ethernet switches) and vde cables (virtual counterpart of a crossed-cable used
to connect two switches).

this package contains cryptcab, which can be used to send encrypted data
over an udp link.
