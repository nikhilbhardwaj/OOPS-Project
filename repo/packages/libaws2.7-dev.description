Ada web server development files
	
aws is a complete framework to develop web based applications. the
main part of the framework is the embedded web server. this small yet
powerful web server can be embedded into your application so your
application will be able to talk with a web browser. around this web
server a lot of services have been developed.


 - a web parameters module. this module takes care of retrieving the
   forms or url parameters and to build an associative table for easy
   access.
 - a session server, this is a very important module to be able to
   keep client's data from page to page.
 - support soap to develop web services.
 - a tool to generate web services stubs/skeletons from a wsdl
   document.
 - a template parser, this module makes it possible to completely
   separate the web design from the code. no more scripting into your web
   page.
 - support for secure sockets (https/ssl), this is based on the gnu tls
   library.
 - support for large servers using dispatchers based on uri, request
   methods.
 - support for virtual hosting (dispatchers based on the host name).
 - support for server push.
 - a directory browser ready to be used in any application.
 - a status page to get many information about the current aws server.
 - a log module. log files keep information about all resources
   requested to the server.
 - hotplug modules which can be loaded/unloaded dynamically to add
   specific features to a server.
 - a communication api to exchange data between applications using the
   http protocol.
 - a configuration api to tune/change the server parameters without
   recompilation.
 - a client api to retrieve any web page from a web site.
 - a web page service to build a simple static page server.
 - support for smtp, ldap and jabber protocols.
