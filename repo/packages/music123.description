a command-line shell for programs like mpg123 and ogg123, music123
plays a variety of sound files using a mpg123/ogg123-like interface.
with all the recommends installed, music123 plays wav, mp3 and
ogg files. by simply changing the config file, music123 can play any
sound file you have a player for.

(if you install a recent version of vorbis-tools, music123 will
handle ogg flac and ogg speex files too.)
