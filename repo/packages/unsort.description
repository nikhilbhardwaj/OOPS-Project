Reorders lines in a file in semirandom ways
	
this program reorders the lines in its input with no regard to the actual
contents. two permutation algorithms are available: randomization
based on a good prng (the mersenne twister algorithm) and "shuffling",
which permutes the lines in such a way that they're spread more or less
evenly in the output. this mode is primarily intended for music playlists.
