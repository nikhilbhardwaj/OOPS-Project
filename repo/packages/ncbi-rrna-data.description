Large rrna blast databases distributed with the ncbi toolkit
	
this package contains some ribosomal rna blast databases distributed
as part of the ncbi c toolkit that are too large and specialized to
include in ncbi-data.  specifically, it contains the databases
combined16srrna_2-12-2008, lsuref_93.fasta, and ssuref_93.fasta,
along with an alias file to facilitate searching all three of them in
conjunction with the 16score database included in ncbi-data.
