The autopoint program from gnu gettext
	
the `autopoint' program copies standard gettext infrastructure files
into a source package.  it extracts from a macro call of the form
`am_gnu_gettext_version(version)', found in the package's
`configure.in' or `configure.ac' file, the gettext version used by the
package, and copies the infrastructure files belonging to this version
into the package.
