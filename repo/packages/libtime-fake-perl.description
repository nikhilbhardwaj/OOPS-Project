Simulate different times without changing your system clock
	
use this module to achieve the effect of changing your system clock, but
without actually changing your system clock. it overrides the perl builtin
subs time, localtime, and gmtime, causing them to return a "faked" time
of your choice. from the script's point of view, time still flows at the
normal rate, but it is just offset as if it were executing in the past or
present.
