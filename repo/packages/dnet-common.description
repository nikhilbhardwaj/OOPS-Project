Base package for linux decnet
	
this is the base package for linux decnet. it contains the necessary
configuration files and a script to set up the mac address of your
ethernet card(s) at boot-up.

you will also need to be running a 2.4+ kernel and have decnet either
built as a module or compiled into the kernel.

to do useful work with decnet you will need the libdnet package and
probably also dnet-progs.
