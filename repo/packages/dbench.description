The dbench (disk) and tbench (tcp) benchmarks
	
dbench and tbench simulate the load of the netbench "industry
standard" benchmark used to rate (windows) file servers.  unlike netbench,
they do not require a lab of microsoft windows pcs: dbench produces
the filesystem load on a netbench run, and tbench produces the
network load, allowing simpler bottleneck isolation.

note that this benchmark is *not* a realistic reflection of normal
server load.
