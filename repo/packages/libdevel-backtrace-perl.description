Object-oriented backtrace
	
devel::backtrace provides methods for accessing backtrace information, i.e.
it allows to see the "route" through a script. it returns short or detailed
information about backtrace points as strings.

the included devel::dollarat module gives some additional functionality to
the $@ scalar, i.e. it makes interpreting exceptions easier.
