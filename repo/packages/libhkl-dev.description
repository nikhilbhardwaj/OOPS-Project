Diffractometer computation control library - development files
	
the hkl library is a framework for diffraction computation and
diffractometer control, heavily used at the soleil synchrotron. it
supports various types of diffractometer geometry: eulerian 4-circle,
eulerian 6-circle, kappa 4-circle, kappa 6-circle, and z-axis
geometry. for each of these it provides several numerically computed
modes, such as bisector and constant psi.

this package provides everything needed to link against hkl.
