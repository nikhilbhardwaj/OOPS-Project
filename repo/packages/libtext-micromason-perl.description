Simple and extensible templating module
	
text::micromason interpolates blocks of perl code embedded into text strings.
each micromason object acts as a "template compiler" which converts templates
from text-with-embedded-code formats into ready-to-execute perl subroutines.
if you want to use the text::template compatibility mode, you will also need
to install text::balanced.
