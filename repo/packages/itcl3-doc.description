[incr tcl] oop extension for tcl - manual pages
	
[incr tcl] (or itcl) is a popular object-oriented extension for the
embeddable tcl scripting language.  the name is a play on c++, and
itcl has a similar object model, including multiple inheritance and
public and private classes and variables.  unlike most oop extensions
to tcl, itcl is written in c for speed.

this package contains the man pages for the new commands that itcl
adds to tcl.
