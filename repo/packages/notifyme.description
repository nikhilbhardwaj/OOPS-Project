A program to notify the user when other one logs in
	
notifyme is a gpl'ed unix (tested under linux, freebsd and openbsd)
console  utility that stays in a background (it isn't a daemon but it
doesn't  block terminal) and prints a message if a specified login
and/or logout occurs. in a resource file ($home/notify.rc by default)
you can specify (extended regular expressions are allowed) usernames,
hostnames and terminals  that should be monitored, optional messages
that will be displayed and other options (beep, report logouts etc.)
see notifyrc.sample for examples. it should be self explanatory.
