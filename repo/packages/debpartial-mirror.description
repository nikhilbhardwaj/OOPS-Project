Tools to create partial debian mirrors
	
mirroring of partial debian repositories is easy with the
debpartial-mirror tool.

with it, you can mirror selected sections, priorities, packages,
virtual packages, or even files and directories matching regular
expressions.  packages may be drawn from any number of sources,
with dependencies for each source resolved from whichever other
sources you specify.
