A ball-and-paddle game with nice graphics
	
lbreakout2 is a game similar to the classics breakout and xboing, featuring
a number of added graphical enhancements and effects.  you control a paddle
at the bottom of the playing-field, and must destroy bricks at the top
by bouncing balls against them.

lbreakout2 is a complete rewrite of the game "lbreakout".  users of
lbreakout probably want to install this.
