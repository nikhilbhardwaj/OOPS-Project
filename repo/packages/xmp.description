awe cards xmp takes advantage of the oss sequencer to play modules with
virtually no system load. using software mixing, xmp plays at sampling
rates up to 48 khz in mono or stereo, 8 or 16 bits, signed or unsigned,
little or big endian samples with 32 bit linear interpolation. xmp
currently supports more than 40 module formats.
