Dummy transition package for cgi::application plugins packages
	
this package only exists to transition to the
libcgi-application-basic-plugin-bundle-perl and
libcgi-application-extra-plugin-bundle-perl packages.  all the code that used
to be in this package is now contained in those packages so after one or both
has been installed, you can remove this one.
