Lightweight, unobtrusive, dvorak-optimized text editor
	
a very small and efficient display editor built upon a philosophy of making
interaction with unix text manipulation commands easy, rather than duplicating
their features. its command set is optimized for the dvorak and qwerty
keyboard layouts.

also includes asdfg, aoeui's qwerty variant.
