Apache 2 fastcgi module for long-running cgi scripts
	
this is a fastcgi module for the apache 2.x web server.  fastcgi is an
open standard for communicating between a web server and a long-running
web application.  cgi scripts supporting fastcgi can be started as a
daemon and process multiple requests without restarting.  this is
particularly useful for scripts written in languages like perl, as it
saves the cost of recompiling the scripts and its loaded modules with
each invocation.
