Implements an entry widget with history
	
tk::histentry implements an entry widget with history. you may use the up
and down keys to select older entries (or use the associated listbox).

the widget comes in two flavors: the "histentry" widget is an
inherited browseentry widget where you see history in the associated
listbox, too. the "simplehistentry" widget is a plain entry widget.
