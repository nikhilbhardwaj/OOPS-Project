Vi improved - common files
	
vim is an almost compatible version of the unix editor vi.

many new features have been added: multi level undo, syntax
highlighting, command line history, on-line help, filename
completion, block operations, folding, unicode support, etc.

this package contains files shared by all non gui-enabled vim
variants (vim and vim-tiny currently) available in debian.
examples of such shared files are: manpages, common executables
like xxd, and configuration files.
