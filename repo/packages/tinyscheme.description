Very small scheme implementation
	
tinyscheme is an implementation of the algorithmic language scheme that
aims to very small memory footprint while being as close to r5rs as
practically feasible.  tinyscheme is also a good base for hacking,
given the implementation's small size, easy gluing with c and code
being fully reentrant.

tinyscheme is based on an s-expression evaluator.  this package
distributes tinyscheme as a standalone executable.
