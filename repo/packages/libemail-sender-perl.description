Perl module for sending email
	
email::sender is a perl module provides an interface to send email via many
backends, including sendmail, smtp, delivering directly to mbox file, etc.

email::sender replaces the old and sometimes problematic email::send library
(see libemail-send-perl), which did a decent job at handling very simple mail
sending tasks, but was not suitable for serious use for a variety of reasons.
