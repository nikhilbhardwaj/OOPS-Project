Under x, asks user for a passphrase for ssh-add
	
this is jim knoble's free implementation of the ssh-askpass program.

jim calls this x11-ssh-askpass, but i've decided to call it ssh-askpass to
make it easier to find, because this is almost certainly the version you
want.  other ssh-askpass programs are available, some of which may integrate
better into various desktop environments.
