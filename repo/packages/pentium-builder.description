Force pentium optimized compilation
	
replaces gcc, cc, and g++ with scripts that build pentium optimized code.
(other processors can be optimized for as well.)

by default, after installing this package, the compilers will behave
normally. however, if the environment variable debian_buildarch=pentium
is set, they will enter pentium optimized compile mode.
