The ginac symbolic framework (debugging symbols)
	
ginac (which stands for "ginac is not a cas (computer algebra system)") is a
library for doing symbolic (i.e. non-numeric) computation directly in the c++
programming language.

this package provides an unstripped shared library with debugging symbols. the
library is installed in /usr/lib/debug and will be automatically used by
gdb while debugging programs using the ginac library. most people will not
need this package.
