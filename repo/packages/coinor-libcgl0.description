Cut generator library, a library of cutting-plane generators
	
the cut generation library (cgl) is an open collection of cutting plane
implementations ("cut generators") for use in teaching, research, and
applications.

cgl is part of the larger coin-or initiative (computational infrastructure
for operations research) and can be used with other coin-or packages that
make use of cuts, such as the mixed-integer linear programming solver cbc.

this package contains the binaries and libraries.
