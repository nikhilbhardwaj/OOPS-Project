The gnustep gui backend - common files
	
it is a backend component for the gnustep gui library.
the implementation of the gnustep gui library is designed in two parts.
the first part is the front-end component which is independent of platform
and display system.  this front-end is combined with a back-end
component which handles all of the display system dependent such as
specific calls to the x window system.

this package contains the common files needed by the gnustep gui backend.
