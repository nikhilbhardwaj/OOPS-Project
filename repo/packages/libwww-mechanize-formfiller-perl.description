Framework to automate html forms
	
www::mechanize::formfiller is intended as a simple way to fill out html forms
from a set of predetermined values. you set up the form filler with value
elements, retrieve the html form, and let the form filler loose on that form.

there are value classes provided for many tasks - fixed values, values
to be queried interactively from the user, values taken randomly from
a list of values and values specified through a callback to some perl code.
