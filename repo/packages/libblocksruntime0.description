Blocks runtime library
	
blocks are a proposed extension to the c, objective c, and c++ languages
developed by apple to support the grand central dispatch concurrency engine.
blocks are anonymous inline functions that automatically capture a read-only
copy of local variables, and have read-write access to local variables that
are declared with the "__block" storage class.

this package contains a library that is needed by programs that use blocks.
