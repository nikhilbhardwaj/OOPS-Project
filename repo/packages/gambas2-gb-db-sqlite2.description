The gambas sqlite2 driver database component
	
gambas is a programming language based on a basic interpreter with
object extensions - like visual basic, though it is not a clone!
it has many components for developing internationalized,
desktop-independent, database- and network-enabled applications.
even games can be developed very quickly using its rad environment.

this component allows you to access to sqlite 2 databases (not for sqlite 3,
there is another package for sqlite 3) from gambas code.
