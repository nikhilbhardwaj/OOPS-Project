glusterfs is a clustered file-system capable of scaling to several
peta-bytes. it aggregates various storage bricks over infiniband rdma
or tcp/ip interconnect into one large parallel network file
system. glusterfs is one of the most sophisticated file system in
terms of features and extensibility.  it borrows a powerful concept
called translators from gnu hurd kernel. much of the code in glusterfs
is in userspace and easily manageable.
