Plugins for vim, adding bells and whistles
	
vim is a very capable editor. its scripting support allows the use of plugins
that enhance the functionality of it. many people have written scripts, they
are scattered all over the web; however, there's a central resource on
http://vim.sf.net to start with.

this is a collection of some of those scripts on a purely subjective and biased
basis.  users can thus have some nice scripts without having to go searching.
the scripts can be installed globally or on a per user basis.
