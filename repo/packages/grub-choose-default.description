Control grub default through a gui
	
grub-choose-default gives you a gui that you can use to easily select the next
default for grub and you can go and grab a snack while your computer reboots
without having to wait for anything.

it's a very simple program that just reads your grub menu entries and then
lets you click on the one you want to be the next default.
