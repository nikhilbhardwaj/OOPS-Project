Date-time libraries based on generic programming (default version)
	
this package forms part of the boost c++ libraries collection.

these libraries are intended to make programming with dates and times
almost as simple and natural as programming with strings and integers.

this package is a dependency package, which depends on debian's default
boost version (currently 1.42).
