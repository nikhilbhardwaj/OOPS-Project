Afs distributed filesystem client support
	
afs is a distributed filesystem allowing cross-platform sharing of
files among multiple computers.  facilities are provided for access
control, authentication, backup and administrative management.

this package provides basic client support to mount and manipulate
afs.  if your site uses kerberos v5 authentication for afs, you will also
want to install openafs-krb5.
