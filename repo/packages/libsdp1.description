Library to allow use of infiniband sockets direct protocol (sdp)
	
libsdp is a ld_preload-able library which can be used to make an application
use the infiniband sockets direct protocol (sdp) rather than tcp. the change
in protocol is transparent and does not require the application to be
recompiled.
