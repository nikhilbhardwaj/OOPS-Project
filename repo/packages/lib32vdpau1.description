Video decode and presentation api for unix (32-bit libraries)
	
vdpau (video decode and presentation api for unix) is an open source
library (libvdpau) and api designed by nvidia originally for its geforce
8 series and later gpu hardware, targeted at the x window system on unix
operating-systems (including linux, freebsd, and solaris). this vdpau api
allows video programs to offload portions of the video decoding process
and video post-processing to the gpu video-hardware.

this package contains the vdpau wrapper and trace 32-bit libraries.
