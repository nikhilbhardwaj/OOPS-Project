Parallel solver libraries within an object-oriented software framework
	
the trilinos project is an effort to develop and implement robust
parallel algorithms using modern object-oriented software design,
while still leveraging the value of established numerical libraries
such as petsc, aztec, the blas and lapack. it emphasizes abstract
interfaces for maximum flexibility of component interchanging, and
provides a full-featured set of concrete classes that implement all
abstract interfaces.

this package contains the headers and static libraries.
