Poe component for running asynchronous http transactions
	
poe::component::client::http is an http user-agent. it allows other sessions
to run while http transactions are being processed and can handle several http
transactions in parallel. rather than being created as proper objects, clients
are spawned as separate sessions; for full details, see the documentation.
