Command line tools to compute graph automorphisms
	
nauty (no automorphisms, yes?) is a set of procedures for determining
the automor- phism group of a vertex-coloured graph. it provides this
information in the form of a set of generators, the size of the
group, and the orbits of the group. it is also able to produce a
canonically-labelled isomorph of the graph, to assist in isomorphism
testing.  this package provides the main command line tool dreadnaut,
and some utilities ('gtools').  a c api is also available.
