Library that presents unified interface to mail representations
	
"email::abstract" provides module writers with the ability to write
representation-independent mail handling code. where previously one
would either have to specify the mail class required, or to build a new
object from scratch, "email::abstract" can be used to perform certain
simple operations on an object regardless of its underlying representation.
