Isdn utilities - connection logger
	
this package provides a set of utilities that can log isdn connections and
calculate the cost of calls. if sufficient data is available, it can even
recommend which alternate carrier would have been cheaper for a given call.
for countries where calls are charged per discrete unit, it can disconnect
the line just before the next unit starts.
