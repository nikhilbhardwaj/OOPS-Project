Host and network monitoring system - core files
	
icinga is a modular monitoring framework for hosts, services, and
networks, based on the nagios project. it is designed to be easy to
understand and modify to fit any need.

features include:

 * monitoring of network services via ping, smtp, pop3, http, nntp, or
   tcp port;
 * plugin interface to allow for user-developed service checks;
 * contact notifications when problems occur and get resolved (via
   email, pager, or user-defined method)
 * support for proactive problem resolution (handlers can be defined to
   be run during service or host events);
 * web output: current status, notifications, problem history, log
   file, etc.


this package provides the core of icinga without the web front-end.
