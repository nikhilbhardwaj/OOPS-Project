Ldap-like embedded database - development files
	
ldb is a ldap-like embedded database built on top of tdb.

what ldb does is provide a fast database with an ldap-like api designed
to be used within an application. in some ways it can be seen as a
intermediate solution between key-value pair databases and a real ldap
database.

this package contains the development files.
