Program for mpeg audio stream validation
	
mp3val is a small, high-speed tool for mpeg audio files validation
and (optionally) fixing problems.

it was primarily designed for verification of mpeg 1 layer iii (mp3)
files, but supports also other mpeg versions and layers.

it can be useful for finding corrupted files (e.g. incompletely
downloaded).
