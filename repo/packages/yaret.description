A console tool to turn cds into encoded music
	
yaret is a perl script that automates the ripping, normalization, and
encoding of cds. it supports cddb very well via the perl audio::cd
module, and also can work with your favorite ripper/normalizer/encoder
(e.g., cdparanoia, cdda2wav, normalize, etc.) it supports useful
features like multiple concurrent encoders and an easy to use
configuration file that lets you customize yaret to your taste (such as
file naming based on the cddb information).
