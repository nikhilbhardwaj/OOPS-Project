Transitional dummy package which can be safely removed
	
this package used to contain a pam module creating a file in
/var/run/console/ for all users logged in to the console.  this
functionallity is now provided by the libpam-ck-connector package,
and this package is now a dummy package to pull in libpam-ck-connector.
