Gnome ip display applet
	
giplet is a simple gnome panel applet that displays your
computer's ip address. giplet can either display the ip
address of a specified ethernet interface or the ip address
the outside world sees.

giplet can also be set to recheck every so often in case
your router resets or the ip address is renewed.
