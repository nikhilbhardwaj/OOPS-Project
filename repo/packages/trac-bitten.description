Continuous integration plugin for trac
	
bitten is a trac extension for continuous integration. it uses
a distributed build model, where one or more "slaves" run the
actual tests, and a "master" gathers the results and displays
them nicely on a web page.

bitten is similar to buildbot, gump (apache), hudson (sun), or
tinderbox (mozilla), but integrated well into trac.

this package contains both the bitten master, which integrates into
trac and the bitten slave, which performs the actual build.
