A gssapi interface module for python
	
this python package is a high-level wrapper for kerberos (gssapi) operations.
the goal is to avoid having to build a module that wraps the entire
kerberos.framework, and instead offer a limited set of functions that do what
is needed for client/server kerberos authentication based on
<http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4559.txt>.

much of the c-code here is adapted from apache's mod_auth_kerb-5.0rc7.
