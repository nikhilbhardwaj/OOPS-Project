Ruby extension for the ncurses c library
	
all c functions are wrapped by module functions of the module "ncurses",
with exactly the same name. additionally, c functions expecting a window* as
their first argument can also be called as methods of the "ncurses::window"
class.

the panel library (for support of overlapping windows) is also wrapped, in
the module "ncurses::panel".

this package is a dependency package, which depends on debian's default
ruby version (currently 1.8.x).
