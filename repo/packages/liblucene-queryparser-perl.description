Turn a lucene query into a perl data structure
	
this module parses a lucene query. it deals with fields, types, phrases,
subqueries, and so on; everything handled by the simplequery class in
lucene. the data structure is similar to the one given above, and is
pretty self-explanatory.

the other function, deparse_query turns such a data structure back into
a lucene query string. this is useful if you've just been mucking about
with the data.
