A powerful tool for visualizing 3-dimensional data sets
	
ifrit (the ionization front interactive tool) has its origins (and
hence name) in a specialized utility designed to visualize ionization
fronts in cosmological numerical simulations.  ifrit, however, has
outgrown its origins and now can visualize general data sets as well.

ifrit is written in c++ and is based on two state-of-the-art toolkits:
the visualization toolkit (vtk) and a gui toolkit qt.
