Module to emulate class::accessor::fast using moose attributes
	
moosex::emulate::class::accessor::fast attempts to emulate the behavior of
class::accessor::fast as accurately as possible using the moose attribute
system.

the public api of class::accessor::fast is wholly supported, but the private
methods are not. if you are only using the public methods (as you should) then
migrating to this is trivial.
