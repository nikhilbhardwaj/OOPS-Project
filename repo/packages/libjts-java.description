Jts topology suite
	
jts is a java library which provides:

 * an implementation of the spatial data model defined
   in the ogc simple features specification for sql (sfs)
 * a complete, consistent, implementation of fundamental 2d spatial algorithms
 * an explicit precision model, with algorithms that gracefully handle
   situations that result in dimensional collapse
 * robust implementations of key computational geometric operations
 * i/o in well-known text format
