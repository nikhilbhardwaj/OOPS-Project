Ruby library for embedding c/++ external module code
	
ruby inline is an analog to perl's inline::c. out of the box,
it allows you to embed c/++ external module code in your ruby script
directly. by writing simple builder classes, you can teach how to cope with
new languages (fortran, perl, whatever).

this is a dummy package depending on the library for the current default
version of ruby.
