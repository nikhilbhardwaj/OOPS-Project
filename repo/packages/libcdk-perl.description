Perl interface for a curses widget library
	
cdk stands for "curses development kit".  cdk sits on top of the curses
library and provides 22 ready to use widgets for rapid application
development of text-based interfaces.  cdk delivers many of the common
widget types required for a robust interface.  widgets can be combined
to create complex widgets if needed.

this package provides a perl interface for the cdk library.
