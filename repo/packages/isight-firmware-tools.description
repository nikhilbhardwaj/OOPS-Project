Tools for dealing with apple isight firmware
	
apple built-in isight requires firmware that can be extracted from
the mac os x usbvideo driver. this package provides tools for extracting
the firmware from the driver and installing udev rules and tools to
automatically load the firmware when needed.

a convenient tool for converting firmware binaries to intel hex format
is also provided. this may be required later for use with a
generic firmware loader such as fxload.
