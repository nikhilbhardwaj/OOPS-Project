A library for parsing gnu style command line arguments
	
argtable is an ansi c library for parsing gnu style command line arguments.
it enables a program's command line syntax to be defined in the source code as
an array of argtable structs. the command line is then parsed according to that
specification and the resulting values are returned in those same structs where
they are accessible to the main program. both tagged (-v, --verbose, --foo=bar)
and untagged arguments are supported, as are multiple instances of each
argument. syntax error handling is automatic and the library also provides the
means for displaying the command line syntax directly from the array of
argument specifications.

argtable can function as a "getopt_long" replacement, without the user of the
program noticing the difference. unlike "getopt_long", however, argtable is
cross platform, working on all posix systems, as well as windows and mac.

this package contains the files needed to develop applications that use
argtable.
