Compute the melting temperature of nucleic acid duplex
	
this program computes, for a nucleic acid duplex, the enthalpy, the
entropy and the melting temperature of the helix-coil
transitions. three types of hybridisation are possible: dna/dna,
dna/rna, and rna/rna. the program first computes the hybridisation
enthalpy and entropy from the elementary parameters of each crick's
pair by the nearest-neighbor method. then the melting temperature is
computed. the set of thermodynamic parameters can be easily changed,
for instance following an experimental breakthrough.
