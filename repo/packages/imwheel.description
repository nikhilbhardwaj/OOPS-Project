Program to support non-standard buttons on mice in linux
	
many mice have side or "thumb" buttons that see limited use in linux, as well
as a wheel that is not used by many older applications.

imwheel supports these non-standard buttons and/or wheel operations by
allowing the user to map their input to specific key combinations depending
on the application in use.
