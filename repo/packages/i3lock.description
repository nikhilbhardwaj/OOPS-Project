A slightly improved version of slock
	
i3lock improves slock by making it fork() and therefore combinable with
commands to suspend your computer. additionally, instead of turning off
your screen via dpms and/or displaying a black screen, i3lock displays a
white screen so you can see if your computer failed to resume from suspend
or if your screen is just locked. also, when entering a wrong password,
i3lock does not call xbell(). this is important because i3lock/slock think
you've entered a password when resuming from suspend, at least sometimes.
