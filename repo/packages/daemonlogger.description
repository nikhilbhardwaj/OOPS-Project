Simple network packet logger and soft tap daemon
	
daemonlogger is a simple packet logger and soft tap daemon that is
incredibly useful for network security analysts.

it is capable of operating in two modes: sniffing packets and
logging them directly to disk (files are automatically rolled over
after 1gb of data), or in a "soft-tap" mode where it mirrors packets
on another interface.

daemonlogger can be run either in the foreground or in the background
as a daemon.
