Comprehensive set of aliasing operations
	
aliasing is the phenomenon where two different expressions actually
refer to the same thing. modifying one will modify the other, and if
you take a reference to both, the two values are the same.

data::alias is a module that allows you to apply "aliasing semantics"
to a section of code, causing aliases to be made whereever perl would
normally make copies instead. you can use this to improve efficiency
and readability, when compared to using references.
