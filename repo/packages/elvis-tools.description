Text editing tools for programmers (elvfmt, elvtags, ref)
	
this package contains elvtags (for generating tags and refs
files), ref (for quickly locating/displaying the header of a
function) and elvfmt (for adjusting paragraphs of text).

these tools actually belong to the elvis editor but can be used
without it.
