Dependency sorter for ocaml source files
	
the ocamldsort command scans a set of objective caml source files (.ml
and .mli files), sorts them according to their dependencies and prints
the sorted files in order to link their corresponding .cmo files.

ocamldsort can be used to compile and link simple projects with one
command.

however for larger projects where separate compilation is desirable,
ocamldsort can also be used from within a makefile as described in the
documentation.
