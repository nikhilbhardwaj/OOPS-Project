Ruby daemons library
	
daemons provides an easy way to wrap existing ruby scripts (for example
a self-written server) to be run as a daemon and to be controlled by
simple start/stop/restart commands.  daemons can also run and control
blocks of ruby code in a daemon process.

this is a dependency package which depends on debian's default ruby
version (currently 1.8.x).
