Desktop sharing utility
	
kde desktop sharing is a manager for easily sharing a desktop session with
another system.  the desktop session can be viewed or controlled remotely by
any vnc or rfb client, such as the kde remote desktop connection client.

kde desktop sharing can restrict access to only users who are explicitly
invited, and will ask for confirmation when a user attempts to connect.

this package is part of the kde networking module.
