High speed arbitrary size integer math for perl
	
math::gmp was designed to be a drop-in replacement both for
math::bigint and for regular integer arithmetic.  unlike bigint,
though, math::gmp uses the gnu gmp library for all of its
calculations, as opposed to straight perl functions.  this can result
in speed improvements.

the downside is that this module is not 100% compatible to math::bigint.
