Iso9660 checksum utilities
	
isomd5sum is a set of utilities for implanting a md5 checksum in an
iso (or any block device), then verifying the checksum later.  isomd5sum
is not simply an md5 of the entire iso; it checksums the data inside a
standard iso9660 image and write block checksum information to an iso9660
header, that will carry over to burning the cd.

this package contains the utilities implantisomd5 and checkisomd5.
