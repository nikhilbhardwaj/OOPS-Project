Burrows-wheeler aligner
	
burrows-wheeler aligner (bwa) is a program that aligns relatively short
nucleotide sequences against a long reference sequence such as the human
genome. it implements two algorithms, bwa-short and bwa-sw. the former works
for query sequences shorter than 200 bp and the latter for longer sequences up
to around 100 kbp. both algorithms do gapped alignment. they are usually more
accurate and faster on queries with low error rates.
