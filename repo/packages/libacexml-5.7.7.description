Ace sax based xml parsing library
	
this package provides interfaces for xml parsing based on simple api
for xml (sax) 2.0, defined by david megginson. this is an
event-driven parsing approach.

acexml is a small footprint and portable library. it does not
validate xml documents and supports only unicode encoding.
