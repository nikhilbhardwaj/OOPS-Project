Network i/o grapher
	
iog is a network traffic grapher designed to record cumulative kb/mb/gb
statistics per hour/day/month. it is intended to be simple, fast
(supporting thousands of hosts), and well integrated with mrtg. data for
each host is updated hourly and html graphs are created. it uses a
data consolidation algorithm which allows for a small, non-growing
database file for each host. no external graphing libraries or
executables are required.
