Decode raw digital camera images
	
this utility converts the native (raw), format of various digital
cameras into netpbm portable pixmap (.ppm) image.  supports the
following models: canon, kodak, olympus, nikon, fuji, minolta and
sigma (see http://www.cybercom.net/~dcoffin/dcraw/ for full list)
note: this utility does not read directly from the cameras, only
the files after they have been downloaded, use gphoto2 for that.
