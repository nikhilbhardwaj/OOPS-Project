A multicast beacon
	
dbeacon is a multicast beacon. its main purpose is to monitor other beacon's
reachability and collect statistics such as loss, delay and jitter between
them.

dbeacon supports both ipv4 and ipv6 multicast, collecting information using
both any source multicast (asm) and source-specific multicast (ssm).

this package also includes dbeacon matrix, a perl script to generate beacon
reachability matrices in html.
