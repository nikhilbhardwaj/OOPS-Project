Nagios remote plugin executor server
	
nagios is a host/service/network monitoring and management system.

the purpose of this addon is to allow you to execute nagios plugins on a
remote host in as transparent a manner as possible.

this program runs as a background process on the remote host and processes
command execution requests from the check_nrpe plugin on the nagios host.
