Haskell support for regexp based pattern matching - documentation
	
harp, or haskell regular patterns, is a haskell extension that extends
the normal pattern matching facility, allowing the user to match against
regular expressions. this expressive power is highly useful in a wide
range of areas, including text parsing and xml processing. regular
expression patterns in harp work over ordinary haskell lists ([]) of
arbitrary type. harp is implemented as a pre-processor to ordinary haskell.
