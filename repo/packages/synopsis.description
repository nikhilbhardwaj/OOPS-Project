Source-code introspection tool
	
synopsis is a multi-language source code introspection tool that
provides a variety of representations for the parsed code to enable
further processing such as documentation extraction, reverse
engineering, and source-to-source translation.

synopsis provides a framework of c++ and python apis to access these
representations and allows processor objects to be defined and
composed into processing pipelines, making this framework very
flexible and extensible.
