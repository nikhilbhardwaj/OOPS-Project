Simple tools for data analysis (stda)
	
stda includes some primary tools for data analysis - you can evaluate
sums, averages, integrals, histograms and distributions of 1-d data, and
eventually plot the results. the separate programs are stand-alone tools
(supporting the standard unix input and output pipelines) to be used for
data processing from the command line. the package provides utilities for
straightforward analysis in situations where a complex analytical approach
is not necessary and  where an ultimate numerical precision with
floating-point numbers is not critical.
