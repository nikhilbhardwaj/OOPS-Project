Perl module to dump subroutine parameters concisely
	
devel::partialdump is similar in nature to data::dumper, however, it is
optimized for the common case of bug reporting with complex data structures.
outputting a string containing a complex data structure can yield rather
useless results, since the structures are stringified.

this module optionally overrides carp's routines to provide a concise dump of
a variable's contents instead of a simple stringification with warn, etc.
