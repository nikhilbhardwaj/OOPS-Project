Java bytecode manipulation library
	
the library presents itself as a collection of routines to manipulate java
bytecode. it allows for the dynamic creation of java class files without
using of javac. such tailored code can be used, i.e. as for the upstream's
motivation of the biojava developers, to generate implementations of
hidden markov models. it thus acts much like inline assembly for java.
