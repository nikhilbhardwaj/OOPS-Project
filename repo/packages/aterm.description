Afterstep xvt - a vt102 emulator for the x window system
	
aterm is a colour vt102 terminal emulator, based on rxvt 2.4.8 with
some additions of fast transparency, intended as an xterm replacement
for users who do not require features such as tektronix 4014
emulation and toolkit-style configurability. as a result, aterm uses
much less swap space -- a significant advantage on a machine serving
many x sessions. it was created with afterstep window manager users
in mind, but is not tied to any libraries, and can be used anywhere.
