Remake of old arcade classic in opengl
	
pong2 is an up till now two player (networked) game inspired
by the classical "pong" from amiga, which adds another
dimension to the playing field. it makes use of features found
on modern 3d graphics cards, so decent hardware is a requirement.

it also has multiplayer support! 2 players can play against
each other via network.
