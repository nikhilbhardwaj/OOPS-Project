Monitoring a system via ps-like commands
	
this program runs the ps command periodically and triggers commands on matches.
the match patterns are perl regular expressions which can refer to the process
information via variables.

for example it can be used to ensure that a daemon is running, or is not
running too many times. it can also be used to determine when a process has
consumed too many resources, perhaps due to a memory leak.
