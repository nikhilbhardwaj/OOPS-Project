Gnu r routines for bayesian ecological inference
	
this is a set of routines for gnu r that implement imai and lu's
parametric and nonparametric bayesian ecological inference algorithms
using markov chain monte carlo estimation.  ecological inference is a
statistical technique designed to recover individual-level information
from aggregate-level data.

the suggested r-cran-mcmcpack package includes other ei estimators that
may be useful alternatives to those included in this package.
