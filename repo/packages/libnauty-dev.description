Library for computing graph automorphisms (development files)
	
nauty (no automorphisms, yes?) is a set of procedures for determining
the automorphism group of a vertex-coloured graph. it provides this
information in the form of a set of generators, the size of the
group, and the orbits of the group. it is also able to produce a
canonically-labelled isomorph of the graph, to assist in isomorphism
testing.  this package provides a c api.
