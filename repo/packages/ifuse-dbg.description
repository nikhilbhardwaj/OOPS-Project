Fuse module for iphone and ipod touch devices
	
ifuse is a fuse filesystem driver which uses libiphone to connect to iphone
and ipod touch devices without needing to "jailbreak" them. ifuse uses the
native apple afc protocol over a normal usb cable in order to access the
device's media files.

although ifuse is now in a working state it is still under heavy
development and should be considered experimental.

this package contains the debugging symbols.
