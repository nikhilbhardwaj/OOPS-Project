Kernel logging daemon
	
the klogd daemon listens to kernel message sources and is responsible
for prioritizing and processing operating system messages.  the klogd
daemon can run as a client of syslogd or optionally as a standalone
program.  klogd can now be used to decode eip addresses if it can
determine a system.map file.
