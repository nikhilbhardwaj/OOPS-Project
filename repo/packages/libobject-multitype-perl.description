Perl objects as hash, array, scalar, code and glob at once
	
the object::multitype module returns an object that works like a hash,
array, scalar, code and glob object at the same time.  it uses tie and
override magic to expose to the perl level the intrinsic typeglob-ness
of all references. if this does not make sense to you, you probably will
not be using it directly, although you may wind up installing it as a
dependency of something else.
