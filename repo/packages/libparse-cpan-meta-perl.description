Module to parse meta.yml and other similar cpan metadata files
	
parse::cpan::meta is a parser for meta.yml files, based on the parser from
yaml::tiny. since the tiny implementation supports a basic subset of the
full yaml specification, it has enough parts to implement parsing of typical
meta.yml files. parse::cpan::meta provides a very simply api of only two
functions, based on the yaml functions of the same name. wherever possible,
identical calling semantics are used.
