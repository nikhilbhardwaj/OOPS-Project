Tiny window manager
	
tinywm is a small, simple window manager.  it has a minimal memory
footprint, which makes it useful in embedded systems.  it features window
move, resize, and raise operations, and supports "sloppy focus".

due to its simplicity, its source code (in c and python) can be used as a
reference implementation for developers seeking to understand basic window
manager programming.
