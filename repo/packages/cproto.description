Utilities to generate c function prototypes from c source code
	
cproto is a program that generates function prototypes and variable
declarations from c source code.  it can also convert function
definitions between the old style and the ansi c style.  this
conversion overwrites the original files, so make a backup copy of
your files in case something goes wrong.
