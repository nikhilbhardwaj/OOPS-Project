Uniforum message translations system compatible i18n library
	
libintl-perl is an internationalization library for perl that aims to be
compatible with the uniforum message translations system as implemented for
example in gnu gettext.

this package contains the xs implementation of uniforum message translation,
which is, thanks to the use of c code and libraries, a little bit faster than
the pure perl implementation.
