Highly configurable system monitor (transitional package)
	
conky is a system monitor that can display just about anything,
either on your root desktop or in its own window.
conky has many built-in objects, as well as the ability to execute
external programs or scripts (either external or through built-in
lua support).

this is a dummy package to ease transition to the new packaging scheme.
it may be safely removed after upgrade/installation.
