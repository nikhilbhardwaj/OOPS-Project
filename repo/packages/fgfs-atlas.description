Flight gear map viewer
	
atlas allows you to see your position on a scrolling world map as you
fly around with flight gear, and even print your own flight charts.
it reads terrain data from flight gear's scenery database. note that
using it for real world navigation purposes is strongly discouraged
and probably illegal.
