Open text summarizer (development)
	
ots reads a text and decides which sentences are important and which
are not.  then it creates a short summary or will highlight the main
idea in the text (the output can be html).  ots is m17n'd and
works with utf-8 encoding.

this package contains files used for development with ots.
