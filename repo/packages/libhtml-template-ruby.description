A ruby class to use html templates
	
this implements a html::template class similar to perl's one. its
main goal is to implement a complete selectivity between design
and logic easily. the html files are known as templates with
prospective variables to be replaced by their values by the ruby
cgi script. also, you can deal with a nested block, a loop and a
conditional expression.
