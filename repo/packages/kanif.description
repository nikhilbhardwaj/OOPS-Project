Cluster management and administration swiss army knife
	
kanif is a tool for high performance computing clusters management and
administration. it combines the main functionalities of well-known cluster
management tools such as c3, pdsh and dsh, and mimics their syntax. it
provides three tools to run the same command on several nodes ("parallel
ssh", using the 'kash' command), to broadcast the copy of files or
directories to several nodes ('kaput' command), and to gather several
remote files or directories locally ('kaget' command). it relies on taktuk
for efficiency and scalability.
