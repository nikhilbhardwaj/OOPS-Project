Schedules commands to be executed later
	
postpone schedules a command to be executed later when a lockfile disappears.
intended usage is when a command is executed possibly multiple times, but
running once is sufficient. this happens in maintainer scripts of debian
packages, for example, tex packages need to rebuild several indices.
