Qt 1.x and 2.x compatibility includes
	
this package contains header files that are intended for build
compatibility for applications that build with qt3 but still use
deprecated includes. it is meant as an intermediate solution and
these header files are not part of the official qt3 api.
all sourcecode that is still using the headers of this package is
subject to be changed to use the new header files which are in
libqt3-headers.
