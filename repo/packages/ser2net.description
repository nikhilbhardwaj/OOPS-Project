Allows network connections to serial ports
	
this daemon allows telnet and tcp sessions to be established with a
unit's serial ports. combined with a terminal emulation like xterm or
the linux console, this can be a very simple means of communicating
with routers, other systems' serial consoles and other equipment with
a serial port. this is remarkably similar to the reverse telnet
feature of some cisco routers.
