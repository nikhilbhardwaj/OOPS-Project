Fits image display and simple analysis
	
spydr (pronounced like spider) basically is an fits image viewer. it
can work as a stand-alone application but is best integrated in a
yorick-based data-analysis work-flow (yorick is an interpreted
language specialized in numerical computations and scientific
graphics). it includes tools to zoom, produce cuts, histograms,
gaussian/moffat fits, psf fits (inc. fwhm and strehl). can work on
single images, sequences of images or data cubes.
