Gnu r package for haplotype analysis
	
the package provides routines for the gnu r statistics environment
for statistical analysis of indirectly measured haplotypes with traits
and covariates when linkage phase is ambiguous.  the statistical methods
assume that all subjects are unrelated and that haplotypes are ambiguous
(due to unknown linkage phase of the genetic markers). the main functions
are: haplo.em, haplo.glm, haplo.score, haplo.power, and seqhap.
