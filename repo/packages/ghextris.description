A tetris-like game on a hexagonal grid
	
the object of the game is basically the same as in tetris; use the
pieces that fall down from the top of the game area to construct
fully filled lines, which will then disappear to make room for more
pieces. the twist is that the pieces are composed of hexagonal
blocks, so your visualization skills will get an extra workout.
