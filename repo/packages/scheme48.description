A simple, modular, and lightweight scheme implementation
	
scheme48 is an implementation of scheme written by richard kelsey
and jonathan rees. it is based on a byte-code interpreter and
incorporates such elements as a sophisticated module system, a
pre-emptive & user-level thread system, a well-integrated
interactive environment, clinger's explicit renaming low-level
macros, and decent efficiency for its architecture.
