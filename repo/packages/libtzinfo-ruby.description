Ruby library for transformations between time zones
	
tzinfo is a ruby library that uses the standard tz (olson) database to provide
daylight savings aware transformations between times in different time zones.
the tz database is compiled into ruby modules which are packaged in the
release. no external zoneinfo files are required at runtime.

this is a dependency package which depends on debian's default ruby version
(currently 1.8).
