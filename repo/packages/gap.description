Groups, algorithms and programming computer algebra system
	
gap is a system for computational discrete algebra with particular
emphasis on computational group theory, but which has already proved
useful also in other areas.   in the example text, gap is used to
analyse rubik's cube using group theory.  a kernel implements a pascal-like
language.

this is a dummy package that depends on the standard gap components.
