Perl module for accessing ph servers
	
net::ph is a perl class implementing a simple nameserver/ph client as
described in ccso nameserver -- server-client protocol or rfc 2378.  the
ph protocol is now mostly obsolete, replaced at most sites by ldap.  this
module is only of interest if you know you need to access a ph server.
