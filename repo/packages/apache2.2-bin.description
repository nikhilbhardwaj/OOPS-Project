Apache http server common binary files
	
the apache software foundation's goal is to build a secure, efficient and
extensible http server as standards-compliant open source software. the
result has long been the number one web server on the internet.

this package contains all binaries but no configuration or support scripts.
to get a stand-alone server, you need to install one of the apache2-mpm-*
packages, such as worker or prefork. other packages like gnome-user-share
may bring their own apache configuration, though.
