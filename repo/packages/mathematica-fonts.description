Installer of mathematica fonts
	
this package downloads mathematica fonts through an internet
and installs them, because the license prohibits distribution of
the fonts.  note the fonts might be removed from a web site so it
might happen that you failed to download the fonts.

this package will install only afm, ttf and type1 at present.
