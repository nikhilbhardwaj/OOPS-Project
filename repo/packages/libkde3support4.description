The kde 3 support library for the kde 4 platform
	
the classes here are only for convenience of porting from kde 3 to kde 4
platform. they are not supposed to be used for a long time. you should move on
to replacement classes provided by the framework or implement something
yourself in the long run.

this package is part of the kde development platform libraries module.
