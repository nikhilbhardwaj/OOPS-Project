A userspace rcu (read-copy-update) library
	
this data synchronization library provides read-side access which scales
linearly with the number of cores. it does so by allowing multiples copies of
a given data structure to live at the same time, and by monitoring the data
structure accesses to detect grace periods after which memory reclamation is
possible.
