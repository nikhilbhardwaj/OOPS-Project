Tools to enhance or analyze the security of the local system
	
harden-tools helps you to install tools that the administrator can
use to enhance the security of the local system in some way.

note! this package will not make your system uncrackable, and it is
not intended to do so. making your system secure involves a lot
more than just installing a package.

for more information on how to secure your system see:
