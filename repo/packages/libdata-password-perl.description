Perl extension for assessing password quality
	
data::password checks potential passwords for crackability. it checks
that the password is in the appropriate length, that it has enough
character groups, that it does not contain the same chars repeatedly or
ascending or descending characters, or characters close to each other in
the keyboard. it will also attempt to search the ispell word file for
existance of whole words.
