Core libraries for the merb mvc framework
	
ruby-based mvc framework that is agnostic to orm, javascript library,
and template languages. merb is plugin-based, so the core is small and
well organized.

this package is a dependency package, which depends on the package
containing actual ruby merb-core libraries for the default ruby version
(currently 1.8).
