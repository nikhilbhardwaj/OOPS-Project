A perl module for simple terminal control
	
term::readkey is a compiled perl module dedicated to providing simple
control over terminal driver modes (cbreak, raw, cooked, etc.,) support for
non-blocking reads, if the architecture allows, and some generalized handy
functions for working with terminals. one of the main goals is to have the
functions as portable as possible, so you can just plug in "use
term::readkey" on any architecture and have a good likelyhood of it working.
