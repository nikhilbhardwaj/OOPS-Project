Apache http server common files
	
the apache software foundation's goal is to build a secure, efficient and
extensible http server as standards-compliant open source software. the
result has long been the number one web server on the internet.

this package contains the configuration and support scripts.
however, it does *not* include the server itself; for this you need to
install one of the apache2-mpm-* packages, such as worker or prefork.
