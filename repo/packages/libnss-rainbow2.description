Nss library for rainbow
	
rainbow is a isolation shell which implements portions of the bitfrost
security architecture, as used on the olpc xo-1 and elsewhere.

this package contains an "name service switch" plugin for glibc which
permits rainbow to easily create and remove users and groups without
modifying /etc/passwd and /etc/group.
