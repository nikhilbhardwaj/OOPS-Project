Pragma for using the c3 method resolution order
	
class::c3 is a perl pragma that modifies the standard method resolution order
from depth-first left-to-right to the more sophisticated c3 method resolution
order.

the c3 algorithm aims to provide a sane method resolution order with multiple
inheritance. it was first introduced in the dylan language, later adopted for
python 2.3. it is also the canonical mro implementation for perl 6 classes
and is the default for parrot objects as well.
