Creative ascii drawing utility by ian
	
cadubi is an application written in perl that allows you to draw
text-based images that are viewable on typical unix-based consoles.
usually the applications that emulate these consoles support various
text modes, such as background and foreground colors, bold, and inverse.

this text art, commonly called "ascii art", is used in various places
such as online bbses, email and login prompts.
