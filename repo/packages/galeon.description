Gnome web browser for advanced users
	
a standards compliant web browser, which integrates well with the gnome
desktop environment.  it does not include an email client, irc bot, website
designer etc., therefore has a moderate resource usage.  internally the
program uses mozilla's gecko rendering engine to display the web pages so
is fully feature complete and standards compliant, as well as rendering pages
quickly.
