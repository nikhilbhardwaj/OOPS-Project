Library for solving eeg and meg forward and inverse problems
	
openmeeg provides state-of-the art tools for processing eeg and meg
data.

the forward problem is implemented using the symmetric boundary
element method [kybic et al, 2005], providing excellent accuracy,
particularly for superficial cortical sources.  the source
localization procedures implemented in openmeeg are based on a
distributed source model, with three different types of
regularization: the minimum norm, and the l2 and l1
norms of the surface gradient of the sources [adde et al, 2005].

this package provides static libraries and header files.
