A powerful object-oriented display - common files

engine. a gnomecanvasitem is a gtkobject representing some element of the
display, such as an image, a rectangle, an ellipse, or some text. you can
refer to this architecture as structured graphics; the canvas lets you deal
with graphics in terms of items, rather than an undifferentiated grid of
pixels.
