Blinks keyboard leds for tx and rx network packets
	
tleds monitors network traffic by blinking the scrolllock keyboard led
when a network packet leaves the machine and the numlock led when one is
received.

warning: on some systems tleds has been reported to render part or all of
the keyboard unusable.  this is rare and usually only happens on a few
laptops and keyboards with overly long or old cables.  (this includes the
ibm thinkpad 600 laptop, and the hp omnibook xe2.)
