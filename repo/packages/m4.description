A macro processing language
	
gnu `m4' is an implementation of the traditional unix macro
processor.  it is mostly svr4 compatible, although it has some
extensions (for example, handling more than 9 positional parameters to
macros).  `m4' also has builtin functions for including files, running
shell commands, doing arithmetic, etc.  autoconf needs gnu `m4' for
generating `configure' scripts, but not for running them.
