Lightweight object framework for perl
	
mouse is a lightweight perl object framework based largely on the techniques
created for moose, the leading perl framework for painless oo class creation.
it is designed to be similar in functionality to moose, though faster, by only
providing a subset of moose's functionality, alleviating some of the compile-
time penalty incurred by moose. it also has considerably less dependencies.
