Genomics application for assembling millions of very short dna sequences
	
the short sequence assembly by k-mer search and 3′ read extension
(ssake) is a genomics application for aggressively assembling
millions of short nucleotide sequences by progressively searching for
perfect 3′-most k-mers using a dna prefix tree. ssake is designed to
help leverage the information from short sequences reads by
stringently clustering them into contigs that can be used to
characterize novel sequencing targets.
