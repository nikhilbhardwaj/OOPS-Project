Update a non-networked computer using apt and removable media
	
these scripts simplify the process of using dselect and apt on a
non-networked debian box, using removable media like zip floppies and
usb keys.
one generates a `fetch' script (supporting backends such as wget and
lftp, in a modular, extensible way) to be run on a host with better
connectivity, check space constraints of your removable media, and
then install the package on your debian box.
