The super sed stream editor
	
super sed reads the specified files or the standard input if no files are
specified, makes editing changes according to a list of commands, and
writes the results to the standard output.

super sed is an enhanced version of gnu sed 3.02. relative to 3.02, there
are several new features (including in-place editing of files, extended
regular expression syntax and a few new commands) and some bug fixes.
