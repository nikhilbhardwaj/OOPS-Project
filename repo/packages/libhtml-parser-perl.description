Collection of modules that parse html text documents
	
html::parser is a collection of modules useful for handling html documents.
these modules used to be part of the libwww-perl distribution, but are now
unbundled in order to facilitate a separate development track.

objects of the html::parser class will recognize markup and separate it from
content data. as different kinds of markup are recognized, the corresponding
event handler is invoked. the document to be parsed may also be supplied in
arbitrary chunks, making on-the-fly parsing of network documents possible.
