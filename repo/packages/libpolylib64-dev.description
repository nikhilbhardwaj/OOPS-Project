Development files for the long int version of polylib
	
polylib is a free c library for doing computations on polyhedra.
the library is operating on objects like vectors, matrices, lattices,
polyhedra, z-polyhedra, unions of polyhedra and other intermediary
structures.
it provides functions for all important operations on these structures.

this package contains the header files and static libraries which are
needed for developing polylib applications.
