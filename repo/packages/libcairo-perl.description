Perl interface to the cairo graphics library
	
libcairo-perl provides access to the cairo library.

cairo is a 2d graphics library with support for multiple
output devices. it is designed to produce consistent output
on all output media while taking advantage of display hardware
acceleration when available (eg. through the x render extension).

the cairo api provides operations similar to the drawing
operators of postscript and pdf. operations in cairo including
stroking and filling cubic b√©zier splines, transforming and compositing
translucent images, and antialiased text rendering. all drawing
operations can be transformed by any affine transformation (scale,
rotation, shear, etc.)
