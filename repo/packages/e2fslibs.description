Ext2/ext3/ext4 file system libraries
	
the ext2, ext3 and ext4 file systems are successors of the original ext
("extended") file system. they are the main file system types used for
hard disks on debian and other linux systems.

this package provides the ext2fs and e2p libraries, for userspace software
that directly accesses extended file systems. programs that use libext2fs
include e2fsck, mke2fs, and tune2fs. programs that use libe2p include
dumpe2fs, chattr, and lsattr.
