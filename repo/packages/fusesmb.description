Filesystem client based on the smb file transfer protocol
	
fusesmb is a filesystem client based on the smb file transfer protocol. this
gives the ability to transparently exchange files with microsoft windows
servers and unix servers running samba.

it is based on fuse (userspace filesystem framework for linux), thus you will
have to prepare fuse kernel module to be able to use it.
