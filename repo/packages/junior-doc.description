Debian jr. documentation
	
includes, for the moment, just the "quick guide" which helps a new user
of debian jr. get started.  the intention of the debian jr. working
group is to provide a variety of additional documents to help children
and sys admins alike with the installation, configuration, and use of a
debian jr. system.
