Very small, efficient, console-only getty and login
	
fgetty is a small, efficient, console-only getty for linux.  it is derived
from mingetty but hacked until it would link against diet libc to produce
the smallest memory footprint possible for a simple yet complete getty.

fgetty includes a login program that supports the checkpassword
authentication interface, and also a checkpassword program that uses the
standard c library interface to passwd and shadow.
