Tracks usage of tcp/ip and builds html files with graphs
	
bandwidthd tracks usage of tcp/ip network subnets and builds html files
with graphs to display utilization. charts are built by individual ips.
color codes http, tcp,udp, icmp, vpn, p2p, etc.

this is the postgresql version of bandwidthd which supports multiple sensors
and uses a dynamic (php-based) web interface. if you don't need these features
then using the package bandwidthd is suggested.
