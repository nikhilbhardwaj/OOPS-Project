Log rotation utility
	
the logrotate utility is designed to simplify the administration of
log files on a system which generates a lot of log files.  logrotate
allows for the automatic rotation compression, removal and mailing of
log files.  logrotate can be set to handle a log file daily, weekly,
monthly or when the log file gets to a certain size.  normally, logrotate
runs as a daily cron job.
