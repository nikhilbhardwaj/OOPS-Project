Portable tools library development debug files
	
this package contains the shared and static debug symbols of the library
ptlib, which is a moderately large class library that has its genesis
many years ago as a method to produce applications to run on both
microsoft windows and unix x-window systems.  this is not the debug compiled
version of ptlib which would yield much more detailled information as a
compromise of benefit and compile power consumption.
