Perl module to exclude files/directories for version control systems
	
many tools need to be equally useful both on ordinary files, and on
code that has been checked out from revision control systems.

file::find::rule::vcs provides quick and convenient methods to
file::find::rule for exclusion of the version control directories of
several major version control systems (currently cvs, subversion,
bazaar, rcs, git and mercurial).
