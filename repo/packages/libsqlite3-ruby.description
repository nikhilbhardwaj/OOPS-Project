Sqlite3 interface for ruby
	
sqlite3/ruby module allows ruby programs to interface with the sqlite3
database engine.

note that this module is not compatible with sqlite 2.x.

this package is a dependency package, which depends on the package
containing actual sqlite3 module for the default ruby version
(currently 1.8).
