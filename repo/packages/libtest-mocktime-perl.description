Replace actual time with simulated time
	
test::mocktime enables test suites to test code at specific points in time.
specifically it overrides the localtime, gmtime and time functions at compile
time and then relies on the user supplying a mock time via set_relative_time,
set_absolute_time or set_fixed_time to alter future calls to gmtime, time or
localtime.
