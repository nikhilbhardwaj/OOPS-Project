Debian policy manual and related documents
	
this package contains:

   - debian policy manual
   - linux filesystem hierarchy standard (fhs)
   - authoritative list of virtual package names
   - paper about libc6 migration

it also replaces the old packaging manual; most of the still-relevant
content is now included as appendices to the policy manual.
