Data abstraction library based on glib -- development files
	
libgda is a (relatively small) database abstraction/access library
integrated on the glib object model. it can be used as a metadata
extractor, to get information about all database objects in a common
way, and as an odbc-like wrapper to access data in different engines
through an easier api.

this package contains the header files and libraries needed for
development.
