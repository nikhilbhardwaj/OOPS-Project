sooperlooper is a live looping sampler capable of immediate loop recording,
overdubbing, multiplying, reversing and more. it allows for multiple
simultaneous multi-channel loops limited only by your computer's available
memory.

the application is a standalone jack client with an engine controllable via
osc and midi. it also includes a gui which communicates with the engine via
osc (even over a network) for user-friendly control on a desktop.
