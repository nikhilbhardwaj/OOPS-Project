Perl module for a simple and fast object-oriented delegation
	
this module provides a subset of the functionality of damian conway's lovely
class::delegation module.

however the specification semantics of class::delegator differ slightly
from those of class::delegation, so this module isn't a drop-in
replacement for class::delegation.
