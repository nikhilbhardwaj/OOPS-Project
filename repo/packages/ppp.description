Point-to-point protocol (ppp) - daemon
	
the point-to-point protocol provides a standard way to transmit
datagrams over a serial link, as well as a standard way for the machines
at either end of the link to negotiate various optional characteristics
of the link.

this package is most commonly used to manage a modem for dial-up or
certain kinds of broadband connections.
