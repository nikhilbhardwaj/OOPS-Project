Perl interface to the gnu aspell library
	
this module provides a perl interface to the gnu aspell library.  the
gnu aspell library provides access to system spelling libraries,
including a spell checker.

this module is to meet the need of looking up many words, one at a
time, in a single session.  it is a perl xs interface which should
provide good performance in comparison to forking the aspell program
for every word.
