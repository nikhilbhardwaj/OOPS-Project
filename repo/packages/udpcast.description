Multicast file transfer tool
	
udpcast can send data simultaneously to many destinations on a lan.
this can be used, for example, to install entire classrooms of pcs at
once.  the advantage of udpcast over other methods (such as nfs, ftp,
etc.) is that udpcast uses ethernet’s multicast abilities, which means
it won’t take longer to install 15 machines than it would to install
just two.
