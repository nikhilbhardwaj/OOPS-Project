Apache-perl module that enables to authorize a user with ldap attributes
	
after you have authenticated a user (perhaps with apache::authnetldap ;)
you can use apache::authznetldap to determine whether they are authorized to
access  the web resource under this modules control.

you can control authorization via one of four methods. the first two are
the pretty standard user and valid-user require, the second two are group or
ldap-url which are unique to ldap.
