Simple, extensible, embeddable programming language
	
lua is a powerful, light-weight programming language designed for extending
applications.  the language engine is accessible as a library, having a c
api which allows the application to exchange data with lua programs and also
to extend lua with c functions.  lua is also used as a general-purpose,
stand-alone language through the simple command line interpreter provided.

this package contains developer resources for using the lua library.
install it if you are developing programs which use the lua c api.
