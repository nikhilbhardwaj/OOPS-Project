A java spell-checking library.
	
jortho (java orthography) is a spell-checker entirely written in java.
its dictionaries are based on the free wiktionary project and can therefore
be updated for virtually any language.

the library works with any jtextcomponent from the swing frame work.
this includes jtextpane, jeditorpane and jtextarea.

the version packaged is based on jortho 0.4, slightly adapted for the needs
of freeplane. see http://jortho.sourceforge.net/.
