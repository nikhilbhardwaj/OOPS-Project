Console-based network traffic monitor
	
vnstat is a network traffic monitor for linux. it keeps a log of
daily network traffic for the selected interface(s). vnstat is not
a packet sniffer. the traffic information is analyzed from the /proc
filesystem, so vnstat can be used without root permissions.
