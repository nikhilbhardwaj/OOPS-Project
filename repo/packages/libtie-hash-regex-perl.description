Module to match hash keys using regular expressions
	
the tie::hash::regex module allows hash keys to be matched using regular
expressions.

in comparison to tie::regexphash, rather than using regexps as keys that match
against fetches, tie::hash::regex allows the use of standard keys that are
matched by regexps in fetches.
