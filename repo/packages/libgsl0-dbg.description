Gnu scientific library (gsl) -- debug symbols package
	
the gnu scientific library (gsl) is a collection of routines for
numerical analysis.  the routines are written from scratch by the gsl
team in c, and present a modern api for c programmers, while allowing
wrappers to be written for very high level languages.

this package contains debugging symbol tables for the static  gsl libraries
libgsl and libgslcblas from the libgsl0-dev package, and the binaries
gsl-randist and gsl-histogram from the gsl-bin package.
