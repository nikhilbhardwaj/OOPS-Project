Lock debugging tool
	
this tool displays mutexes locked and unlocked during execution of a
program, and can provide hints for debugging multithreaded
applications. as it is fairly lightweight and easy to use, it is ideal
at the start of a debugging session or when only limited resources are
available.

it cannot detect data races as it only looks at the synchronisation
primitives themselves; if you need that, use helgrind (in the valgrind
package) instead.
