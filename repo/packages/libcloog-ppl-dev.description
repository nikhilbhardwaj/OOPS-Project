The chunky loop generator (development files)
	
cloog is a software which generates loops for scanning z-polyhedra. that is,
cloog finds the code or pseudo-code where each integral point of one or more
parametrized polyhedron or parametrized polyhedra union is reached. cloog is
designed to avoid control overhead and to produce a very efficient code.

this package contains the development files and the cloog binary.
