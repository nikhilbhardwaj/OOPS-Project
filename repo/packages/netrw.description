Netcat like tool with nice features to transport files over network
	
netrw is a simple (but powerful) tool for transporting data over the
internet. its main purpose is to simplify and speed up file transfers to
hosts without an ftp server. it can also be used for uploading data to
some other user. it is something like one-way netcat (nc) with some nice
features concerning data transfers. netrw can compute and check message
digest (md5, sha-1, and some others) of all the data being transferred,
it can also print information on progress and average speed. at the end
it sums up the transfer.
