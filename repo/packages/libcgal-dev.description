C++ library for computational geometry (development files)
	
cgal (computational geometry algorithms library) makes the most important
of the solutions and methods developed in computational geometry available
to users in industry and academia in a c++ library. the goal is to provide
easy access to useful, reliable geometric algorithms.

this package contains the header files and static libraries.
