Simple opengl image library
	
soil is a tiny c library used primarily for uploading textures into opengl.
it supports loading bmp, png, jpg, tga, dds, psd and hdr files as well as
saving into tga, bmp and dds files.

it is also able to perform common functions needed in loading opengl textures.

this is the shared library potentially needed for some other software to work.
