Library for dealing with email addresses
	
this library contains utility functions for dealing with email addresses.
this includes parsing, splitting and munging email addresses represented
as strings (e.g. in email headers); some additional functions handle
non-latin1 upper- and lower-case conversions.

this package is part of the kde development platform pim libraries module.
