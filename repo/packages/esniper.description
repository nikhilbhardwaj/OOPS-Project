A simple, lightweight tool for sniping ebay auctions
	
esniper is a lightweight ebay sniping tool. it doesn't have a lot of
features, and that is by design.

auctions  are  specified  on the command line, using the auction number
and your bid price.  multiple auctions can be bid on by specifying more
auctions  and  bid prices.  esniper stops when the desired quantity has
been won (default is 1).
