High-level terminal interface library for c++ (development files)
	
libcwidget is a modern user interface library modeled on gtk+ and qt,
but using curses as its display layer and with widgets that are
tailored to a terminal environment.

this package contains files that are needed to write or compile
software that uses libcwidget.

warning: this is a newly created library whose development is closely
tied to the development of aptitude.  its api may be incomplete and
is likely to change considerably version-over-version!  you may want
to avoid cwidget for stable projects.
