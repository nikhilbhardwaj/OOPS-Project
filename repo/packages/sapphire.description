A minimal but configurable x11r6 window manager
	
sapphire is a window manager for x11r6. it is fairly minimal in
what it provides on screen: one toolbar, the usual window borders
and a popup menu from the root window.

it supports themes as x resource files, and the menu is editable.
if you install the 'menu' package, you'll get an automatically updated
'debian' submenu of installed programs.
