Library for implementing gsm 07.10 multiplexing servers
	
this library supports implementing a gsm 07.10 multiplexing server.
it requires libgsm0710 for the protocol engine and glib.

you may either write standalone programs (e.g. communicating over d-bus
and using ptys) or embed the library in your gsm server to improve
performance.

this package is part of the freesmartphone.org software stack
and is targeted for smartphones.
