Configuration monitor to ease collective administration
	
metche monitors changes made to a "system state" composed of:

   - a "watched" directory (typically: /etc)
   - one or more user maintained changelog files
     (e.g. /root/changelog)
   - the state of debian packages and versions (using apt-show-versions)

by periodically:

   - saving backups of the corresponding files
   - emailing the changes in the system state to your administrators'
     mailing list
