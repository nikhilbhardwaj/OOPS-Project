Vim macros that make the vim easier to use for beginners
	
cream's motto is "cream makes the powerful vim text editor easy!". it brings
a completely different look and feel to the vim for those who are used to more
intuitive editors while still preserving the more powerful features of vim.
it features pull-down menus, color themes, bookmarking, auto spellcheck and
more. it leaves the default vim untouched and is started by running 'cream'.
