Linear polymer mass spectrometry software - arch-indep data
	
massxpert is a program to simulate and analyse mass spectrometric
data obtained on linear (bio-)polymers. it is the successor of gnu
polyxmass.

this package contains the architecture-independent data required for
the proper functioning of massxpert. for example, polymer chemistry
definition files are in this package.
