Multiprecision arithmetic library developers tools
	
this development package provides the header files and the symbolic
links to allow compilation and linking of programs that use the libraries
provided in the libgmp3 package.

both c and c++ bindings are present in this package.  package
libstdc++-dev is required to use the c++ bindings.

the mpfr library (multiple-precision floating-point) used to be
included, but has since been moved to package libmpfr-dev.
