Enhancements to the python build system
	
this package provides additional functions to python's distutils and
setuptools. it allows you to easily integrate gettext, icons and gnome
documentation into your build and installation process.

it also provides an "auto" module which provides a "do what i mean" automatic
build system; if you stick to the conventions, you do not need to write
setup.cfg, potfiles.in, or manifest.in, and setup.py just needs to have the
package metadata (such as project name and version).
