Run processes and applications under pseudo-terminal
	
empty is a utility that provides an interface to execute and/or interact with
processes under pseudo-terminal sessions (ptys). this tool is useful in
programming of shell scripts designed to communicate with interactive programs
like telnet, ssh, ftp, etc. in some cases empty can be the simplest
replacement for tcl/expect or other similar programming tools because empty
can be easily invoked directly from shell prompt or script, and does not use
tcl, perl, php, python or anything else as an underlying language.
