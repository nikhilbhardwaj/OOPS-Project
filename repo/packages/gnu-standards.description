Gnu coding and package maintenance standards
	
this package contains two pieces of documentation from the gnu
project: 'gnu coding standards', and 'information for maintainers of
gnu software'.

these are useful to refer to if you are writing or maintaining software
for gnu, but could also be helpful as guidelines for other projects.
