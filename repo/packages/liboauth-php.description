Php library implementing the oauth secure authentication protocol
	
oauth is a simple way to publish and interact with protected data.  it allows
the user to grant access to their private resources on one site, to another
site. while openid is all about using a single identity to sign into many
sites, oauth is about giving access to your stuff without sharing your identity
at all.
