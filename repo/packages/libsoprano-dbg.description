soprano is a pluggable rdf storage, parsing, and serialization framework based
on qt 4.  soprano is targeted at desktop applications that need to store rdf
data.  its api has been optimized for simplicity and ease of use, while its
modular structure allows it to use various different rdf storage
implementations as its backend.

this package contains debugging files used to investigate problems with
binaries included in the soprano packages.
