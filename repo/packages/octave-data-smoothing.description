Functions to do data smoothing on noisy data
	
this package provides functions to do noisy data smoothing in octave,
a numerical computation software. it contains functions to calculate
the divided difference of order d of a vector x (ddmat) and several
functions to do tikhonov data manipulation.

this octave add-on package is part of the octave-forge project.
