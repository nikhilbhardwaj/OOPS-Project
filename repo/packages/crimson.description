A hex-based tactical game
	
crimson fields is a hex-based tactical war game in the tradition of
battle isle (tm). two players command their units on a map of hexagons,
trying to accomplish mission objectives ranging from defending important
locations to simply destroying all enemy forces.
the game can either be played in 'hot seat' mode, via email, or against
the computer. tools are available to create custom maps and campaigns.
you can also play the original battle isle maps if you have a copy of
the game.
