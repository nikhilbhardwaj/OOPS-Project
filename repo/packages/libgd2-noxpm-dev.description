Gd graphics library version 2 (development version)
	
gd is a graphics library. it allows your code to quickly draw images
complete with lines, arcs, text, multiple colours, cut and paste from
other images, flood fills, and write out the result as a png file.
this is particularly useful in world wide web applications, where png is
one of the formats accepted for inline images by most browsers.

this is the full development version of the library, built without xpm
(x pixmap) or fontconfig support.
