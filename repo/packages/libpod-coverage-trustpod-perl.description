Module to support hints for pod::coverage
	
pod::coverage::trustpod is a perl module that extends pod::coverage by
allowing your plain old documentation (pod) to declare certain symbol names
as trusted. it is similar to using the 'trustme' feature in your test file,
but does not require changes to the test file; instead, you make such trust
annotations in your pod in a specially formatted field.
