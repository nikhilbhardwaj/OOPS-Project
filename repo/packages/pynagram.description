Anagram word game
	
pynagram is a simple word game in which the player is presented with seven
letters in a random order. every word that is "solved" from the jumbled letters
earns the player points. if the player solves one or more seven letter words,
the score is carried over into the next game.

pynagram was inspired from anagramarama.
