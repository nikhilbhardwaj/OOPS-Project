Library for multi-way secret-sharing (debug symbols)
	
this library implements shamir's method for secret sharing, which can be
used to split a secret (like a gpg secret key) into multiple parts, so that
at least some number of those parts are needed to recover the original file,
but any smaller combination of parts is useless to an attacker.

this package contains support for debugging programs that use libgfshare.
