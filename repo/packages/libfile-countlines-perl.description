Module for efficiently counting the number of lines in a file
	
perlfaq5 answers the question on how to count the number of lines in a file.
file::countlines is a convenient wrapper around that method, with additional
options.

more specifically, it counts the number of line breaks rather than lines. on
unix systems nearlly all text files end with a newline (by convention), so
usually the number of lines and number of line breaks is equal.
