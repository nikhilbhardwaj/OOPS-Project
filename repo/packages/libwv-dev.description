Development files for the wvware library
	
wvware (previously known as mswordview) is a library that allows access
to microsoft word files.  it can load and parse the word 2000, word 97,
word 95, and word 6 file formats.  (work is underway to support reading
earlier formats as well: word 2 documents are converted to plain text.)

this package contains the static library and header files.
