Pop2 and pop3 mail server
	
imap (internet message access protocol) is a method of accessing
electronic messages kept on a (possibly shared) mail server.

the uw (university of washington) imap toolkit provides the c-client
mail-handling library supporting various network transport methods,
file system storage formats, and authentication and authorization
methods.

this package contains ipopd, a pop2 and pop3 server daemon which uses
the c-client library.
