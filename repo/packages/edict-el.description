An emacs interface to edict
	
this package provides edict.el and associated files, thus allowing
to query the edict japanese-english dictionary from within emacs.

using the region and couple of keystrokes, edict.el will look up the
japanese key and return all the edict entries containing that key, in
a pop-up buffer.  english is even easier, you just put point anywhere
in the word you want to look up.
