A simple chess clock to track time in real life games
	
this is a fairly simple application designed to track the time spent thinking
by the players during a chess game. various ways of tracking time are
supported, with only "countdown" (aka "blitz") and "fisher" for now. the
graphical interface is keyboard driven and is intended to be minimal and
simple. the code is made to be extensible to other game types.
