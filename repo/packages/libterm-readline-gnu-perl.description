Perl extension for the gnu readline/history library
	
term::readline::gnu is a perl interface to the gnu readline library, allowing
developers to provide features including input line editing, input history
management, word completion and more.

through this module, you have access to almost all variables and functions as
documented in the gnu readline/history library. this means you can write your
custom editing function, custom completion function, and so on, with perl.
you may find it useful for prototyping before programming with c.
