Activate or deactivate programs based on bluetooth link quality
	
bluemon monitors the quality of the link to a bluetooth device and can start
or stop programs when the threshold drops below a certain value. this can be
used to perform actions like locking the terminal when you walk away from it.

bluemon uses the dbus system bus to alert other applications to the presence
of bluetooth devices. a user binary can then start or stop programs when such
signals are received.
