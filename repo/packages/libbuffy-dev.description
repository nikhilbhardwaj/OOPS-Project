Base functions for building mailbox summary applications
	
buffy wants to be the ultimate mail folder summary system.

this library provides efficient mailfolder checking routines, packaged in a
library with a simple api and with wrappers for many languages, so that
everyone can create mail folder summary systems in the language they prefer
without having to care about the actual mailbox checking.

libbuffy currently supports detection and summarizing of folders in maildir
and mailbox format.

this package provides the development headers and library for libbuffy.  no
shared library is packaged until the api is stabilized.
