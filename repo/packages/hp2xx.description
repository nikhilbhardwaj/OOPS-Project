A hpgl converter into some vector- and raster formats
	
hp2xx reads hpgl ascii source files, interprets them, and converts them
into either another vector-oriented format or one of several rasterfile
formats. currently, its hpgl parser recognizes a subset of the hp 7550a
command set. some high-level functions are missing. also, only some of the
fixed space vector fonts and none of the variable space arc fonts are
supported. beside these limitations, hp2xx has proven to work with many
hp-gl sources without any trouble.
