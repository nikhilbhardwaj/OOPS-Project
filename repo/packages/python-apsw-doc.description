Documentation for python-apsw
	
apsw (another python sqlite wrapper) is an sqlite 3 wrapper that
provides the thinnest layer over sqlite 3 possible. everything you
can do from the c api to sqlite 3, you can do from python. although
apsw's api looks vaguely similar to python's db-api, it is not
compliant with that api and instead works the way sqlite 3 does.

this package contains the documentation.
