Ruby library for text formatting
	
text::format provides the ability to nicely format fixed-width text with
knowledge of the writeable space (number of columns), margins, and indentation
settings. text::format can work with either tex::hyphen or text::hyphen to
hyphenate words when formatting.

this is a dummy package depending on the library for the current default
version of ruby.
