Openpgp plugin for pidgin
	
pidgin-openpgp is a plugin for the pidgin instant messaging
program which enables it to communicate with jabber/xmpp peers
in an encrypted manner using the openpgp standard and xep-0027,
which is understood by other clients, such as centericq, gajim,
kopete and mcabber.

this is an experimental extension and potentially buggy.
