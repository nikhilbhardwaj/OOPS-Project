A tiny media scanner library -- development files
	
libvalhalla is a scanner and parser library for audio/video files based
on sqlite and ffmpeg/libavformat.

media files are retrieved in paths defined by the user and metadata are
saved in a database. it provides a very simple api and it can use
several parsers concurrently to speed up on a multi-core/cpu system.

this package contains headers and libraries for developing software
that makes use of libvalhalla.
