A better cd encoder
	
a frontend program to cdparanoia, wget, cd-discid, id3, and your favorite
ogg/vorbis, mp3, flac, ogg/speex and/or mpp/mp+(musepack) encoder (defaults
to oggenc). grabs an entire cd and converts each track to the specified
formats and then comments or id3-tags each file, with one command.

with abcde you can encode several formats with one single command, using a
single cd read operation. it also allows you to read and encode while not
on the internet, and later query a cddb server to tag your files.
