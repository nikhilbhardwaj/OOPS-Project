Perl module for reading and writing daap structures
	
a dmap structure is a binary record used in apple's daap protocol.
a dmap structure may contain other dmap structures. fields in a dmap
structure are identified by a short name ("msdc"). the short name is
what's in the binary record, but a content codes list gives a long
name ("dmap.databasescount") and a data type for the record (32-bit
integer).
