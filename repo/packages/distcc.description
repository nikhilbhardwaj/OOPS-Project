Simple distributed compiler client and server
	
distcc is a program to distribute compilation of c or c++ code across
several machines on a network. distcc should always generate the same
results as a local compile, is simple to install and use, and is often
significantly faster than a local compile.  distcc does not require all
machines to share a filesystem, have synchronized clocks, or to have
the same libraries or header files installed.
