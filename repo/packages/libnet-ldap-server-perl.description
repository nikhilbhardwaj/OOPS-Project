Ldap server-side protocol handling in perl
	
net::ldap::server provides the protocol handling for an ldap server.
you can subclass it and implement the request types you need.  once
you accept a connection (e.g. using net::daemon), net::ldap::server
takes care of decoding client requests and encoding your replies.
