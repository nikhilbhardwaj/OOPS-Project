Jam and *.msg capable fidonet tosser
	
crashmail ii is basically a more portable version of
crashmail, a tosser for amiga computers. users of the old
amiga version will probably find some things familiar
while some features are gone such as the arexx port (for
obvious reasons!) and the gui configuration editor. the
only feature that crashmail ii has and the old crashmail
hasn't is support for jam messagebases.
