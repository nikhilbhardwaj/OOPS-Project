Simtec electronics udekey01 entropy key daemon (uds variant)
	
this package augments the ekeyd package with additional support
for running the entropy key using a userland daemon written using
libusb instead of the kernel cdc-acm driver.

you should use this package if you are having difficulty with the
cdc-acm driver such as might be exhibited in linux 2.6.18, 2.6.28
or similarly unstable kernel versions.
