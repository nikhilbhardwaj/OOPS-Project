Interface for collins and langenscheidt dictionaries
	
this is an ncurses interface to the collins english-polish/polish-english
and/or langenscheidt german-polish/polish-german dictionaries distributed by
young digital planet. it can also play the pronunciation samples if the cd is
available.

this package is only the interface, it does not contain the dictionary files
itself. to use it, you need a copy of a dictionary from ydp.
