Gps file conversion plus transfer to/from gps units - gui
	
gpsbabel converts waypoints, tracks, and routes from one format to
another, whether that format is a common mapping format like delorme,
streets and trips, or even a serial upload or download to a gps unit
such as those from garmin and magellan.

this package contains gpsbabelfe, a qt based frontend for gpsbabel.
