Perl extension for parsing iptables firewall rulesets
	
the iptables::parse package provides an interface to parse iptables
rules on linux systems through the direct execution of iptables commands, or
from parsing a file that contains an iptables policy listing.  you can get
the current policy applied to a table/chain, look for a specific user-defined
chain, check for a default drop policy, or determing whether or not logging
rules exist.
