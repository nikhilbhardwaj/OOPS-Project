Connect pipes to get the water flowing from inlet to outlet (data files)
	
if you know the old arcade-game "pipe dreams", you'll instantly recognize
this. the goal is to connect different pipe segments to let the water flow
from the inlet and through as many pipes as possible, until it finally
reaches the outlet. this requires an even combination of speed, skill and
foresight.

(this package contains just the data files; you'll need the pipenightdreams
package as well in order to actually play the game.)
