A utility for tracking non-official package versions
	
apt-forktracer tries to alleviate the problem that apt stops tracking official
versions of a package after you pin it or install a newer version.

it displays a list of packages which are in an inconsistent state or have a
version other than the newest official installed. you can choose to ignore
certain packages - if they match certain criteria - with a configuration file.
