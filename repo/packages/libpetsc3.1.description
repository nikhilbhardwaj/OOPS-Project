Shared libraries for version 3.1 of petsc
	
petsc is the "portable extensible toolkit for scientific computation", a suite
of data structures and routines for the scalable (parallel) solution of
scientific applications modeled by partial differential equations.  it employs
the mpi standard for all message-passing communication.  several sample
scientific applications, as well as various papers and talks, demonstrate the
features of the petsc libraries.
