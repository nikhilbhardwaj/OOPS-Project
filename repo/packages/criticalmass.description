Shoot-em-up a la galaxian
	
criticalmass, aka critter, is a shoot-'em-up in the style of galaxian with
very colorful and smooth graphics (provided that you have 3d acceleration)

note: criticalmass uses opengl, and will probably not run well if you do
not have a 3d accelerator which is supported by x.
