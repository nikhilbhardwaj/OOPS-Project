Numeric 1st and 2nd order differentiation
	
this perl package exports functions for performing numerical first
and second order differentiation on data. the functions take
references to two arrays containing the x and y ordinates of the data
and return an array of the 1st or 2nd derivative at the given x
ordinates. the 2nd derivative may optionally be given values to use
for the first derivative at the start and end points of the data -
otherwise 'natural' values are used.
