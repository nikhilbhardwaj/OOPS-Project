jove is a compact, powerful emacs-style text-editor. it provides the common
emacs keyboard bindings, together with a reasonable assortment of the most
popular advanced features (e.g. interactive shell windows, compile-it,
language specific modes) while weighing in with cpu, memory, and disk
requirements comparable to vi(1).
