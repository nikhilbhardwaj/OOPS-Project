Headers and development libraries for openturns
	
openturns is a powerful and generic tool to treat and quantify
uncertainties in numerical simulations in design, optimization and
control. it allows both sensitivity and reliability analysis studies:

 * defining the outputs of interest and decision criterion;
 * quantify and model the source of uncertainties;
 * propagate uncertainties and/or analyse sensitivity and
 * rank the sources of uncertainty


openturns is a large project with more than 300 c++ classes which
uses well known and supported software such as r for the statistical
methods and blas/lapack for the linear algebra.

this package provides the openturns headers should be used if one
wants to link its application against the library.
