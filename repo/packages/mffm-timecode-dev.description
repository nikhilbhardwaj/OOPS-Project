C++ hierarchy which controls and describes time code
	
time code description is in two modes, integer or digit mode. integer mode
allows easy mathematical manipulation (using c++ operators). digit mode allows
the user to manipulate the time code digit by digit.
more specifically, time code is made of a data window (array) for media data
content. if the multimedia content is audio (1d stream) then a type ii filter
is implemented for this stream.
it also has time based indexes. namely :

 b : beginning - the absolute first time
 s : start - the start time
 c : current - the current time
 e : end - the last time
 f : finish - the absolute last time

for all instances :

 i] b<=s<=e<f
 ii] s<=c<e
