Perl extension for showing/modifying jpeg (meta)data
	
this package provides an interface for reading and interpreting the
content of jpeg segments, in particular of those segments containing
metadata (like tiff headers, thumbnails, exif info, iptc info, comments,
etc.). some segments can even be modified and rewritten to disk.

the author claims that this module is still experimental: use it at your
own risk.
