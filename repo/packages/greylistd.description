Greylisting daemon for use with exim 4
	
this daemon provides a simple greylisting implementation for use with
the exim mail transport agent (mta), version 4.

once installed, you will need to configure your mta to query the
greylistd server.  this package contains a script to automatically
configure exim 4. it may be possible to use greylistd with other mtas
as well. postfix users may want to check out the "postgrey" package
instead of this one.
