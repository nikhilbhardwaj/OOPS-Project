Kernel-based automounter for linux, version 5
	
autofs controls the operation of the automount daemons. the
automount daemons automatically mount filesystems when they
are used and unmount them after a period of inactivity. this
is done based on a set of pre-configured maps.

the kernel automounter implements an almost complete sunos
style automounter under linux. a recent version of the kernel
autofs4 module (builtin or separate) is required.

this is the experimental branch of the autofs daemon.
