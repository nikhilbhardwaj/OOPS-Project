Dvi viewer for x
	
dvilx is a screen-previewer for .dvi-files compiled by tex. it lets you
see what your printed output will look like. you can choose between a
black-and-white representation and greyscaling. you can choose an arbitrary
zoom factor (at some cost of performance). you can set marks to measure
distances. you can search for text strings. you may visit lots of dvi files,
set bookmarks and get them saved to a startup-file. dvilx does not
support pxl-files. dvilx ignores all 'special'-commands and has no
font-replacing mechanism.
