Acpi and hotkey daemon for toshiba laptops
	
fnfx enables owners of toshiba laptops to change the lcd brightness,
control, the internal fan and use the special keys on their keyboard
(fn-x combinations, hot-keys). the internal functions will give the
possibility to map the fn-keys to functions like volume up/down, mute,
suspend to disk, suspend to ram and switch lcd/crt/tv-out. these
functions heavily depend on the system and/or kernel configuration.
you will need at least a kernel (v2.4.x, v2.5.x, v2.6.x) with acpi and
toshiba support (config_acpi and config_acpi_toshiba).
