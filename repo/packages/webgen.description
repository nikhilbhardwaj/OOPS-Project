A template based static website generator
	
webgen is used to generate web pages from page description and template files.
you create one template file in which you define the layout of your page and
where the content should go. after that you can create page description files
in which you only define the content.

this package is historical and kept for users with old webgen sourcefiles. if
your are starting a new webgen project, you should use webgen0.4 package
instead.
