Json library for ruby (default ruby version)
	
this library implements the json (javascript object notation) specification in
ruby, allowing the developer to easily convert data between ruby and json. you
can think of it as a low fat alternative to xml, if you want to store data to
disk or transmit it over a network rather than use a verbose markup language.

this is a dummy package depending on the library for the current default
version of ruby.
