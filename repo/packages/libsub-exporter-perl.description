Sophisticated exporter for custom-built routines
	
when you use a perl module, first it is "required" function used, then its
import method is called.

sub::exporter provides a sophisticated alternative to exporter.pm.  it allows
for renaming, currying/sub-generation etc.

sub::exporter builds a custom exporter which can then be installed into your
module. it builds this method based on configuration passed to its
setup_exporter method.
