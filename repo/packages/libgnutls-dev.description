gnutls is a portable library which implements the transport layer
security (tls) 1.0 and secure sockets layer (ssl) 3.0 protocols.

currently gnutls implements:

 - the tls 1.0 and ssl 3.0 protocols, without any us-export
   controlled algorithms
 - x509 public key infrastructure (with several limitations).
 - srp for tls authentication.
 - tls extension mechanism


this package contains the gnutls development files.
