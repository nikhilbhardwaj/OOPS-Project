Reverse address resolution protocol daemon
	
rarp is a protocol which allows individual devices on an ip network to
get their own ip addresses from the rarp server.
you need this daemon only if you have on your lan machines like
diskless sun boxes.
with kernels up to 2.2 you have the option of using the integrated rarp
support instead of this daemon.
