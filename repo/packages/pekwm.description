Fast & light window manager
	
the pek window manager is written by claes n√§sten,
the code is based on the aewm++ window manager,
but it has evolved enough that it no longer resembles aewm++ at all.
it has a much expanded feature-set, including window grouping
(similar to ion, pwm, or fluxbox), autoproperties, xinerama,
keygrabber that supports keychains, and much more.
