Pam module for migrating to kerberos
	
a stackable authentication module that takes a username and password from an
earlier module in the stack and attempts to transparently add the user to a
kerberos realm using the kerberos 5 kadmin service. the module can be used to
ease the administrative burdens of migrating a large installed userbase from
pre-existing authentication methods to a kerberos-based setup.

this package allows updating the database of a remote heimdal server.
