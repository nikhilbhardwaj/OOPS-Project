Tiny graphics and windowing toolkit using ruby
	
shoes is a very informal graphics and windowing toolkit for making simple
graphical applications.  it blends ideas from the web (hyperlinks, simple text
layout, and more) from traditional windowing toolkits (buttons, progress bars,
dialogs and the like) and applications like nodebox and processing (drawing
anywhere on the window with shapes and curves, simple animation).

shoes uses ruby as its interface language; applications created with it can
run on windows, mac os x and linux.
