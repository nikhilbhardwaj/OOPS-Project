Poe event loop implementation using event
	
poe::loop::tk implements the standard poe::loop event loop interface (see the
documentation from libpoe-perl) for the event library (see libevent-perl). it
provides features needed to manage an event-based event loop in perl in a
consistent fashion and does not differ from the standard interface.
