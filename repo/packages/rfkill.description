Tool for enabling and disabling wireless devices
	
rfkill is a simple tool for accessing the linux rfkill device interface,
which is used to enable and disable wireless networking devices, typically
wlan, bluetooth and mobile broadband.

rfkill uses /dev/rfkill, which is present in linux kernel 2.6.31 and later.
