Perl module for dumping perl objects from/to xml
	
xml::dumper dumps perl data to a structured xml format.

xml::dumper can also read xml data that was previously dumped
by the module and convert it back to perl.

.
this might be useful for dumping perl objects to files
using an xml format that can be reloaded or accessed by
other programs. maybe even other languages.
