Transparent cross compiling environment
	
scratchbox2 uses a ld_preload library to create a transparent cross compiling
environment. scratchbox2 automatically maps file system accesses to
crosscompiler, target libraries and headers using a flexible lua path mapping
engine. together with cpu transparency, provided by qemu or sbrsh, scratchbox2
enables fast crosscompiling without modifying build scripts.
