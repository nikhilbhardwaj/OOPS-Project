Sqlite backend for tntdb database access library
	
this library provides a thin, database independent layer over an sql
database.  it lacks complex features like schema queries or wrapper
classes like active result sets or data bound controls.  instead you
get to access the database directly with sql queries.  the library is
suited for application programming, not for writing generic database
handling tools.

this file has the necessary files for sqlite support.
