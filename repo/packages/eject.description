Ejects cds and operates cd-changers under linux
	
this little program will eject cd-roms (assuming your drive supports
the cdromeject ioctl). it also allows setting the autoeject feature.

on supported atapi/ide multi-disc cd-rom changers, it allows changing
the active disc.

you can also use eject to properly disconnect external mass-storage
devices like digital cameras or portable music players.
