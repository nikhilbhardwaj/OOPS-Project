Library for arbitrary precision arithmetic
	
this package contains the library libcalc.a and the necessary header files
which provide routines to handle arbitrary precision arithmetic with
integers, rational numbers, or complex numbers. there are also many numeric
functions such as factorial and gcd, along with some transcendental
functions such as sin and exp.

this library is also used by the commandline calculator `calc', which is
provided in the debian package `apcalc'.
