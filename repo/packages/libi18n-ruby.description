I18n and localization solution for ruby
	
implementation of the ruby on rails i18n core api.  this is the same i18n
library included in the ruby on rails framework, but provided outside of
that framework for those who wish to use it without pulling the entire
ruby on rails framework.

this is a dependency package which depends on debian's default ruby version
(currently 1.8).
