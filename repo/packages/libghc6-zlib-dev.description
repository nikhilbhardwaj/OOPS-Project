Compression and decompression in the gzip and zlib formats
	
this package provides a library for the haskell programming language.
see http://www.haskell.org/ for more information on haskell.

this package provides a pure interface for compressing and decompressing
streams of data represented as lazy bytestrings. it uses the zlib c library so
it has high performance. it supports the \"zlib\", \"gzip\" and \"raw\"
compression formats.

it provides a convenient high level api suitable for most tasks and for the
few cases where more control is needed it provides access to the full zlib
feature set.
