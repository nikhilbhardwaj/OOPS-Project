Library for threading email by in-reply-to and references
	
the mail::thread module implements something relatively close to
jamie zawinski's mail threading algorithm, as described by
http://www.jwz.org/doc/threading.html.  this algorithm is based
on following references and in-reply-to headers, and is able to
deal with not having all of the messages in a thread.
