Nvi with the evil paperclip
	
vigor is a perpetration of the microsoft word "office assistant" paperclip,
based on nvi. it was inspired by pitr of the "user friendly" comic strip
(http://www.userfriendly.org/).

some people have speculated that vigor was created under the influence of
the evil crud puppy. the maintainer of this debian package would like to
stress his firm belief that these foul rumours are entirely without
foundation.
