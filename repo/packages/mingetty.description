Console-only getty
	
mingetty is a small, efficient, console-only getty for linux.

"getty opens a tty port, prompts for a login name and invokes the
/bin/login command. it is normally invoked by init(8)."

mingetty is a minimal getty for use on virtual consoles. unlike
the getty in the util-linux or mgetty packages, mingetty is not
suitable for serial lines, which is why it's smaller.
