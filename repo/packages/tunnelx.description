Cave survey drawing software
	
tunnel enables you to draw cave surveys based on survex-compatible
centreline data. drawings will be adjusted to fit if the underlying
data moves due to loop closures. original drawings can be used as a
basis to draw over. complex multi-layered surveys can be drawn, and
good use is made of colour to distinguish facets such as levels.
