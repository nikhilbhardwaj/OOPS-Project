Test data for blacs testers
	
the blacs project is an ongoing investigation whose purpose is to
create a linear algebra oriented message passing interface that may be
implemented efficiently and uniformly across a large range of
distributed memory platforms.

you can choose between an implementation based on mpi or pvm. this package
provides test data for all blacs packages (mpi and pvm versions).

most users do not need to install this package directly because it is
installed when installing the test programs for any blacs package.
