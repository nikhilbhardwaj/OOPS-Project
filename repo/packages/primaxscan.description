Primax colorado direct scanner software
	
this is a stand-alone driver program for the primax colorado direct
scanners and compatibles (e.g. storm totalscan, network scanny mm100,
genius colorpage vivid+)

the command must be run by root because it wants direct access to
the hardware parallell port.

the software seems to be written only for i386 hardware.
