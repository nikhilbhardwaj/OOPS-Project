Graph library for ocaml
	
ocamlgraph is a graph library for ocaml. its contribution is
three-fold:


 * it provides an easy-to-use graph data structure together with
   several operations and algorithms over graphs.  it is a
   reasonably efficient imperative data structure for directed
   graphs with vertices and edges labeled with integers.



 * then ocamlgraph provides several other graph implementations
   for those not satisfied with the one above. some are
   persistent (imutable) and other imperative (mutable). some
   are directed and other are not. some have labels for
   vertices, or labels for edges, or both. some have abstract
   types for vertices. etc.
   these implementations are written as functors: you give the
   types of vertices labels, edge labels, etc. and you get the
   data structure as a result.



 * finally, ocamlgraph provides several classic operations and
   algorithms over graphs.
   they are also written as functors i.e. independently of the
   data structure for graphs. one consequence is that you can
   define your own data structure for graphs and yet re-use all
   the algorithms from this library -- you only need to provide
   a few operations such as iterating over all vertices, over
   the successors of a vertex, etc.


this package provides viewgraph and dgraph library to build graph
viewers.
