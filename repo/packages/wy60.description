Wyse 60 terminal emulator
	
this is an emulator for the wyse 60 text mode terminal.
it sets up a emulation environment converting  between
wyse 60(tm) escape sequences and the escape codes of the host
system, and launches a shell to run within this emulated environment,
so it helps also applications with hard coded values to run within this
emulated enviroment.
