Reminds you to take a break from typing
	
xwrits helps you prevent repetitive stress injury.

xwrits is a small reminder program designed to let you know it is time
to take a break from typing to rest your wrists and prevent any damage
to your wrists (or at least make them feel better if you've already
damaged them). normally works on the honor system, but if you find
yourself unable to stop typing during your break, it can also lock your
keyboard.
