Java implementation of a binary protocol for web services
	
hessian provides compact binary and xml protocols for applications
needing performance without protocol complexity.  it is well-suited to
sending binary data without any need to extend the protocol with attachments.
this library also includes burlap that is a matching xml protocol.

with hessian, providing a web service is as simple as creating a servlet and
using a service is as simple as a jdk proxy interface.
