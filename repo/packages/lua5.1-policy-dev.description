Lua 5.1 debian policy - template and scripts
	
this package contains some template/support files (like a generic makefile, a
generic test application...) that can be used by lua libraries at compile
time. it also includes a simple script that sets up an svn directory
conforming to svn-buildpackage and populates it with the standard files needed
to use lua5.1-policy-dev at build time. obviously packages made using
lua5.1-policy-dev will conform to the policy contained in lua5.1-policy.
