3d universe simulator data files
	
openuniverse (ou for short) is  a fun, fast and free
opengl space simulator. it currently focuses on the solar system
and lets you visit all of its planets, most major moons and a vast
collection of smaller bodies in colorful, glorious and realtime
3d.

this package contains all the data that the program needs to run
(textures, star data catalogues, 3d models, fonts) or enhances
it (manuals) under /usr/share/openuniverse.
