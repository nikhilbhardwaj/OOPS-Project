Tool for configuring and maintaining network machines
	
cfengine is a suite of programs for integrated autonomic management
of either individual or networked computers.

cfengine 3 is both a more powerful and much simplified version of cfengine,
which has been designed to inter operate with cfengine 2 rather than be
backwards compatible with it.

with cfengine 3 you can install, configure and maintain computers using
powerful hands-free tools.
