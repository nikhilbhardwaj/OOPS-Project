Pygtkmvc documentation, tutorial and examples
	
this mvc for pygtk2 helps with writing well structured code by splitting the
program's code into three distinctive sections. a program written using this
mvc pattern usually contains four parts: the view (providing access to the
glade widget tree), the controller (providing glue functions), the model
(providing the abstract logic) and the main program (simply connecting the
three parts mentioned before).

this package provides documentation, tutorial and examples.
