Store /etc in git, mercurial, bzr or darcs
	
the etckeeper program is a tool to let /etc be stored in a git, mercurial,
bzr or darcs repository. it hooks into apt to automatically commit changes
made to /etc during package upgrades. it tracks file metadata that version
control systems do not normally support, but that is important for /etc, such
as the permissions of /etc/shadow. it's quite modular and configurable, while
also being simple to use if you understand the basics of working with version
control.
