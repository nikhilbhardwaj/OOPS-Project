A themed widget set provider library for tk
	
the tile widget set is an experimental reimplementation
of some of the standard tk widgets.  the main features are:


   * "revitalized" look and feel under x11
   * appearance controlled by a theme engine, providing
     greater flexibility for custom widgets
   * new widgets, including notebook, progressbar, combobox,
     separator, and sizegrip.
