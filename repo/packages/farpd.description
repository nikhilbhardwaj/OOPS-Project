Fake arp user space daemon
	
this arp daemon replies to any arp request for a set of ip addresses
with the hardware mac address of one of the interfaces of the
server after determining that no other host in the network is claiming
that ip.

this enables a single host to claim all unassigned addresses on a
lan for network monitoring or simulation purposes.
