Tao cli binding for lua - development files
	
the tao framework is a collection of bindings and libraries to
facilitate cross-platform games-related development utilizing the mono
and .net platforms.

lua is a programming language originally designed for extending
applications, but also frequently used as a general-purpose,
stand-alone language.

this package contains development files for the tao.lua library, and
should be used for compilation.
