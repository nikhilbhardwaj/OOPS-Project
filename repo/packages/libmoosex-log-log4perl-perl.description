Logging role for moose based on log::log4perl
	
moosex::log::log4perl is a perl module that provides a moose role, built on
log::log4perl, for use with your moose classes. the initialization of the
log4perl instance must be performed prior to logging the first log message.
otherwise the default initialization will happen, probably not doing the
things you expect.
