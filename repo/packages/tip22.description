Tftp boot image builder for mips based sgi ip22 and ip32 machines
	
tip22 is used to merge kernel and initrd into one bootable image. this
image also contains a small loader stub that copies the kernel to its
load address and appends the ramdisk. this is useful for booting via tftp or
from a cdrom. it is currently targeted for the ip22 and ip32 subarchitectures
but support for other arcs based subarchitectures can easily be added.
