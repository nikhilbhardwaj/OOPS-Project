Common utilities for spelling dictionary tools
	
these are utilities shared by all ispell, myspell and wordlist
dictionaries,  including support for some tools that use ispell
(like emacsen, jed and mutt). more info about naming conventions
and availability of those dictionaries in the readme file.

maintainers should install dictionaries-common-dev as well, and
read its documentation.
