Md2 message digest for perl
	
the digest::md2 module allows you to use the rsa data security inc.
md2 message digest algorithm from within perl programs.  the
algorithm takes as input a message of arbitrary length and produces
as output a 128-bit "fingerprint" or "message digest" of the input.

the digest::md2 programming interface is identical to the interface
of digest::md5.  md2 is described in rfc 1115.
