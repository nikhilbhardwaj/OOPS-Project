Xjavadoc engine
	
the xjavadoc engine is a complete rewrite of sun's javadoc engine
that is faster and more suited for xdoclet (although it is completely
standalone). it scans java source code and makes information about a
class available via special java beans that are part of the xjavadoc
core. these beans provide the same information about a class as sun's
javadoc api, and some nice extra features.
