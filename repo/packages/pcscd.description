Middleware to access a smart card using pc/sc (daemon side)
	
the purpose of pc/sc lite is to provide a windows(r) scard interface
in a very small form factor for communicating to smart cards and
smart cards readers.

the pc/sc daemon is used to dynamically allocate/deallocate reader
drivers at runtime and manage connections to the readers.
