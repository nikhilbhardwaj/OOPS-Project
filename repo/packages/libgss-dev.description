Development and documentation files for generic security services
	
the gnu generic security service library (gsslib) is a free
implementation of the gss-api security framework.  gsslib uses shishi
to implement the kerberos v5 mechanism, but is flexible enough to
support other mechanisms too.

this package contain files for developing programs with gss support,
including the header file and static library, and a tool to explain
gss-api error codes.
