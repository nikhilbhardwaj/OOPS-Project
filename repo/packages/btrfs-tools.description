Checksumming copy on write filesystem utilities
	
btrfs is a new copy on write filesystem for linux aimed at implementing
advanced features while focusing on fault tolerance, repair and easy
administration.

this package contains utilities (mkfs, fsck, btrfsctl) used to work with btrfs
and an utility (btrfs-convert) to make a btrfs filesystem from an ext3.

warning: btrfs is under heavy development, and is not suitable for any uses
other than benchmarking and review.
