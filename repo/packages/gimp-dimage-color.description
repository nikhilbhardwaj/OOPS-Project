Gimp plugin to convert minolta dimage pictures to srgb colour space
	
this plugin converts images produced by some minolta dimage digital
cameras (dimage 5/7 and s304 at least) into srgb colour space. these
cameras produces images in a custom colour space so that pictures
look "washed out" when viewed on a monitor without conversion.

this package enables linux users to do the same conversions as they
can with the minolta dimage viewer utility.
