High availability load balancer for tcp connections
	
fair is a system for implementing load balancers; it consists of two daemons:
carrousel and transponder. carrousel, which performs load balancing services,
typically runs on a load balancer; transponder runs on the servers.

fair understands network topologies where one node is reachable via more than
one ip address; this allows not only the servers, but the network to be
redundant as well. this distinguishes fair from other load balancers.
