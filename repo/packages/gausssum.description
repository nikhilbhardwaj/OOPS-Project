Parse and display gaussian, gamess, and etc's output
	
gausssum parses the output files of adf, gamess, gamess-uk, gaussian, jaguar
and pc gamess calculations to extract useful information.

gausssum uses gnuplot to display the progress of geometry optimisations,
density of states spectrum, uv-vis spectra, ir spectra, raman spectra,
and electron density difference maps. it can also display all lines containing
an arbitrary phrase and more.
