Gem based plugin system
	
gemplugin is a system that lets your users install gems and lets you load
them as additional features to use in your software.  it originated from the
mongrel (http://mongrel.rubyforge.org) project but proved useful enough to
break out into a separate project.

this is a dependency package which depends on debian's default ruby version
(currently 1.8.x).
