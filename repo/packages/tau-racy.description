Tuning and analysis utilities - tcl/tk profiler gui
	
tau is a profiling toolkit specially made for parallel computing
(multi-thread, multi-process, mpi, pvm).

racy (routine and data acces profile display) is a gui that
graphically visualizes profiling data.

racy has been superceded by a set of java tools, and is no more
actively developed.  unfortunately, those tools cannot build yet
using free tools.
