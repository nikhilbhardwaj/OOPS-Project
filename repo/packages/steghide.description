A steganography hiding tool
	
steghide is steganography program which hides bits of a data file
in some of the least significant bits of another file in such a way
that the existence of the data file is not visible and cannot be proven.

steghide is designed to be portable and configurable and features hiding
data in bmp, wav and au files, blowfish encryption, md5 hashing of
passphrases to blowfish keys, and pseudo-random distribution of hidden bits
in the container data.
