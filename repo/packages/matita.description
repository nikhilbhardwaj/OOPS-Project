Interactive theorem prover
	
matita is a graphical interactive theorem prover based on the calculus of
(co)inductive constructions.

matita adopts xml-encoded proof objects are produced for storage and exchange.
this makes it compatible, at some extent, with coq.

the graphical interface has been inspired by ctcoq and proof general. it
supports high quality bidimensional rendering of proofs and formulae
