Interface to gnupg using its coprocess interface
	
gnupg is a perl module that provides a limited programmatic interface to the
gnu privacy guard program. it uses the coprocess hook system provided by gpg
and communicates using shared memory. it attempts to map the interactive
interface offered by the gpg command-line tool to a more programmatic api.
