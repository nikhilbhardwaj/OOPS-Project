Network ups tools - core system
	
network ups tools (nut) is a client/server monitoring system that
allows computers to share uninterruptible power supply (ups) and
power distribution unit (pdu) hardware. clients access the hardware
through the server, and are notified whenever the power status
changes.

this package provides nut's core system, and the serial and usb ups
drivers. in most cases it is sufficient for a basic ups monitoring
system.
