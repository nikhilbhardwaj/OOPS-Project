Load, configure, and compose wsgi applications and servers
	
paste deployment is a system for finding and configuring wsgi applications and
servers. for wsgi application consumers it provides a single, simple function
(loadapp) for loading a wsgi application from a configuration file or a python
egg. for wsgi application providers it only asks for a single, simple entry
point to your application, so that application users don't need to be exposed
to the implementation details of your application.
