Control x from the command line, and find things on the screen
	
control x from the command line for scripts, and do "visual scraping" to
find things on the screen. the control interface allows mouse movement,
clicking, button up/down, key up/down, etc, and uses the xtest extension so
you don't have the annoying problems that xse has when apps ignore sent
events. the visgrep program find images inside of images and reports the
coordinates, allowing programs to find buttons, etc, on the screen to click
on.
