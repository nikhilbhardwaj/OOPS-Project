Perl module to transform utf-8 strings into tex
	
tex::encode provides a simple way to encode arbitrary utf-8 strings into latex
escapes using mapping tables provided by pod::latex and html::entities.

this module only covers a subset of the unicode character set and has limited
facilities for converting tex back to utf-8 (this is because tex is in essence
a programming language, and this module does not yet implement tex).
