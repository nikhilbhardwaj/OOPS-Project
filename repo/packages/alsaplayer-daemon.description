Pcm player designed for alsa (non-interactive version)
	
alsaplayer is a pcm player designed specifically for use with alsa, but
works great with oss or esound.  it's heavily threaded which cuts down on
skipping, offers optional and even simultaneous visual scopes, plays
mp3, mp2, ogg, cdda, audiofs, and lots more.

this package provides a non-interactive (daemon) interface to the player,
so that it is only accessible via a remote control application.
