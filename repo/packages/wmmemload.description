Windowmaker dockapp to monitor memory and swap usage
	
wmmemload displays the current memory and swap usage as a percentage
value. it is based on wmcpuload and wmmemmon, and as such looks very
nice alongside those.

wmmemload is designed to work with the windowmaker dock, but will work with
other window managers as well.
