Library for analyzing compiler options via evolutionary algorithms
	
the acovea (analysis of compiler options via evolutionary algorithm)
library that implements a genetic algorithm to find the "best" options for
compiling programs with the gnu compiler collection (gcc) c and c++
compilers.  "best," in this context, is defined as those options that
produce the fastest executable program from a given source code.

libacovea is part of a c++ framework that can be extended to test other
programming languages and non-gcc compilers.

this package contains the development files for libacovea.
