Performance co-pilot application tracing library
	
the libpcp-trace package contains the runtime environment required by
an application that is directly instrumented for event and value
tracking by pmdatrace(3), the trace performance metric domain agent.

the performance co-pilot provides a unifying abstraction for
all of the interesting performance data in a system, and allows
client applications to easily retrieve and process any subset of
that data.
