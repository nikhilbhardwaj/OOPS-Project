Compiler for the intercal language
	
this package provides a perl-based compiler for the intercal
programming language, usable either from the command line or as a
perl module.

clc-intercal is designed to be almost compatible with the original
(princeton 1972) compiler.  it also implements several extensions to
the original language, including support for object orientation,
operator overloading and quantum computing.
