Base class to treat unhandled method calls as errors
	
it is possible to accidentally inherit an autoload method. often this
will happen if a class somewhere in the chain uses autoloader or
defines one of their own. this can lead to confusing error messages
when method lookups fail.

sometimes you want to avoid this accidental inheritance. in that
case, inherit from class::whitehole. all unhandled methods will
produce normal perl error messages.
