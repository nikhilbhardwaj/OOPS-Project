Combinatorics function for octave
	
this package provides functions to work with combinatorics in octave,
a numerical computation software.  it contains functions for doing
integer partitioning (partcnt and partint), as well as for computing
the combinations of arbitrary sets of values (combs).

this octave add-on package is part of the octave-forge project.
