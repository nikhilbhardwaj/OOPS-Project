Generic mapping tools library
	
these set of libraries allow manipulating geographic and cartesian data sets
(including filtering, trend fitting, gridding, projecting, etc.) and
producing encapsulated postscript file (eps) illustrations ranging from
simple x-y plots via contour maps to artificially illuminated surfaces
and 3-d perspective views.

this package contains the files used for development of programs that
use the gmt libraries (headers, static objects).
