Rfc 2229 compliant modular dictionary server (mediawiki module)
	
gnu dico is an implementation of the dict protocol as defined in rfc 2229.
it is fully modular: the daemon itself (dicod) provides only the server
functionality, and knows nothing about database formats. actual searches
are performed by functions supplied in loadable modules. a single module
can serve one or more databases.

this package contains the module that handles the use of wiktionary or
wikipedia as a dictionary database.
