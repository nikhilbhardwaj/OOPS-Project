C library to create irc clients
	
libircclient is a small but powerful library that implements the
client-server irc protocol. it is designed to be small, fast, portable and
compatible to rfc standards, and most irc clients. libircclient features
include:


 * full multi-threading support.
 * single threads handles all the irc processing.
 * support for single-threaded applications, and socket-based
   applications, which use select()
 * synchronous and asynchronous interfaces.
 * ctcp support with optional build-in reply code.
 * flexible dcc support, including both dcc chat, and dcc file transfer.
 * can both initiate and react to initiated dcc.
 * can accept or decline dcc sessions asynchronously.
 * plain c interface and implementation (possible to use from c++ code,
   obviously)
 * compatible with rfc 1459 and most irc clients.
 * good documentation and examples available.
