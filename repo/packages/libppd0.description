Postscript ppd file library
	
postscript was designed as a device independent language. to be able
to access device specific features like selecting different paper
trays and turning on different imaging models, each printer vendor
supplies a postscript printer definition or ppd file. this library
reads those ppd files and provides functions that allow a program to
modify postscript print jobs to acces these special features.
