pychart is a python library for creating high quality
encapsulated postscript, pdf, png, or svg charts. it
currently supports line plots, bar plots, range-fill
plots, and pie charts. because it is based on python,
you can make full use of python's scripting power.

you need to have ghostscript installed for png generation
and x11 displaying.
