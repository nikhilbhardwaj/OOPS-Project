Distributed irc client - shared data (kde4 version)
	
quassel is a modern, cross-platform, distributed irc client, meaning that
one or more clients can attach to and detach from the central core. it's
much like the popular combination of screen and a text-based irc client
such as weechat or irssi, but graphical.

this package provides files used by the kde4-based quassel client
packages.
