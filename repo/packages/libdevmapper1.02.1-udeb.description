The linux kernel device mapper userspace library
	
this is a udeb, or a microdeb, for the debian-installer.

the linux kernel device mapper is the lvm (linux logical volume management)
team's implementation of a minimalistic kernel-space driver that handles
volume management, while keeping knowledge of the underlying device layout
in user-space.  this makes it useful for not only lvm, but evms, software
raid, and other drivers that create "virtual" block devices.
