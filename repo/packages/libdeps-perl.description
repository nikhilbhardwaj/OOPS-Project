Dependency extraction and processing system
	
toolkit to extract internal dependencies from a project, manipulate
the dependency graph in arbitrary ways, and produce graphs to help in
managing your project, including locating abusive #includes.

it aims to be fully generic and pluggable, but is still under
development.  however, several aspects are already possible to
customize.  eg, you can provide your own graph transformations,
styling rules, and graph renderers.
