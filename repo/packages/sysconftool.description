Development tool to install and update configuration files
	
sysconftool is a development utility that helps to install
application configuration files. sysconftool allows an existing
application to be upgraded without losing the older version's
configuration settings, but that's the advantage over plain dpkg
upgrading, will add new configuration settings (and remove unneeded).
