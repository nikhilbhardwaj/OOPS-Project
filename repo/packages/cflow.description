Analyze control flow in c source files
	
gnu cflow analyzes a collection of c source files and prints a graph, charting
control flow within the program.

gnu cflow is able to produce both direct and inverted flowgraphs for c
sources. optionally a cross-reference listing can be generated. two output
formats are implemented: posix and gnu (extended).

input files can optionally be preprocessed before analyzing.
