Network injection and capture
	
packit is a network auditing tool. its value is derived from its ability
to customize, inject, monitor, and manipulate ip traffic. by allowing you
to define (spoof) nearly all tcp, udp, icmp, ip, arp, rarp, and ethernet
header options, packit can be useful in testing firewalls, intrusion
detection systems, port scanning, simulating network traffic, and general
tcp/ip auditing. packit is also an excellent tool for learning tcp/ip.
