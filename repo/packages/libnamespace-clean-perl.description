Module for keeping imports and functions out of the current namespace
	
namespace::clean is a perl pragma for keeping imported functions out of the
current namespace. this is especially important because perl functions are
naturally available as methods, which can complicate subclassing.

using the namespace::clean pragma will remove all previously declared or
imported symbols at the end of the current package's compile cycle. this
means that functions called in the package itself will still be bound by
their name, but they won't show up as methods on your class or instances.
