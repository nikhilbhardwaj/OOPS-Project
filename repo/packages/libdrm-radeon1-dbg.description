Userspace interface to radeon-specific kernel drm services -- debugging symbols
	
this library implements the userspace interface to the kernel drm services.
drm stands for "direct rendering manager", which is the kernelspace portion
of the "direct rendering infrastructure" (dri). the dri is currently used on
linux to provide hardware-accelerated opengl drivers.

this package provides the debugging symbols for the libdrm-radeon1 package.
