Collection of video4linux support libraries (development files)
	
libv4l is a collection of libraries which adds a thin abstraction layer on
top of video4linux2 devices. the purpose of this (thin) layer is to make it
easy for application writers to support a wide variety of devices without
having to write separate code for different devices in the same class. libv4l
consists of 3 different libraries: libv4lconvert, libv4l1 and libv4l2.

libv4lconvert offers functions to convert from any (known) pixelformat
to bgr24, rgb24, yuv420 and yvu420.

libv4l1 offers the (deprecated) v4l1 api on top of v4l2 devices, independent
of the drivers for those devices supporting v4l1 compatibility (which many
v4l2 drivers do not).

libv4l2 offers the v4l2 api on top of v4l2 devices, while adding for the
application transparent libv4lconvert conversion where necessary.

this package contains development files (headers and static libraries).
