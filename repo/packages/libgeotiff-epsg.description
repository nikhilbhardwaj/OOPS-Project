The geotiff library -- epsg geodetic parameter dataset
	
this c library supports tiff 6.0 based interchange format for georeferenced
raster imagery. the geotiff standard has been developed for reading, and writing
geographic meta-information tags on top of tiff raster.

this package contains epsg geodetic paramenters data files which can be used
with standard projections. these data are useful to better dump geo-contents
of many geotiff files.
