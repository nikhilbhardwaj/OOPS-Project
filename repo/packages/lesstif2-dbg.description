Lesstif2 debugging files
	
lesstif, made by the hungry programmers, is a free (lgpl-ed) version of
osf/motif; it aims ultimately at binary compatibility with motif 2.1.

this package contains the debugging symbols for the libxm and libmrm
libraries and the mwm window manager from the lesstif2 and lesstif-bin
packages.
