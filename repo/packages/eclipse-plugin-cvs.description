Eclipse team integration (cvs support)
	
the eclipse platform is an open and extensible platform for anything and yet
nothing in particular. it provides a foundation for constructing and running
integrated software-development tools. the eclipse platform allows tool
builders to independently develop tools that integrate with other people's
tools so seamlessly you can't tell where one tool ends and another starts.

this package provides cvs support for source code management to the
eclipse team integration component.
