C++ library for webapps [devel] (transition package)
	
wt (pronounced 'witty') is a c++ library and application server for
developing and deploying web applications. the api is widget-centric
and offers complete abstraction of any web-specific application details.

this package installs development files for building software that uses the
wt libraries.

this is a dummy transition package and can be safely removed.
