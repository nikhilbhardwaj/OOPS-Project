Perl module to generate accessors automatically
	
moosex::semiaffordanceaccessor is a module that changes the default naming
policy for the loading class so that methods are separated into accessors
(which have the same name as the attribute) and mutators (via set_ methods).

it is compatible with existing naming schemes, since attributes that explictly
provide a "reader" or "writer" name are left unchanged. the terminology
"semi-affordance" is inspired by david wheeler's class::meta module (see
libclass-meta-perl).
