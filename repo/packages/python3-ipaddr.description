Python3 module for working with ip addresses, both ipv4 and ipv6
	
this library is used to create/poke/manipulate ipv4 and ipv6 addresses
and networks in python3.  it is intended to be fast and lightweight.

this is a pure python3 implementation of classes for ipv4/6 addresses and
networks. it supports comparisons to determine if ip addresses are contained
inside a defined network, conversion of lists of ip addresses into compact
cidr lists, and other ip address manipulation.
