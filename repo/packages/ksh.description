The real, at&t version of the korn shell
	
ksh is a unix command interpreter (shell) that is intended for both
interactive and shell script use. its command language is a superset of
the sh(1) shell language.

the 1993 version adds a number of new, mostly scripting related,
features over the 1988 version that is typically distributed with
commercial unix variants. for example, it has lexical scoping, compound
variables, associative arrays, named references and floating point
math.
