Opentoken lexical analysis library for ada (development)
	
opentoken is a facility for performing token analysis within the ada language.
it is designed to provide all the functionality of a traditional lexical
analyzer generator, such as lex. but due to the magic of inheritance and
runtime polymorphism it is implemented entirely in ada as withed-in code. no
precompilation step is required, and no messy tool-generated source code is
created.

this package contains the development files and associated documentation.
