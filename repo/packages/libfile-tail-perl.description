File::tail perl module
	
the file::tail module is designed for reading files which
are continously appended to (the name comes from the tail -f
directive). usually such files are logfiles of some description.

the module tries hard not to busy wait on the file, dynamicaly
calculating how long it should wait before it pays to try reading the
file again.

the module should handle normal log truncations ("close; move; open" or
"cat /dev/null >file") transparently, without losing any input.
