mysql which allows viewing, editing, and playing audio files via the
web. it has support for playlists, artist and album views, album art,
random or vote-based play and per-user play-tracking/theming.
playback may be via http, on-the-fly transcoding and downsampling,
mpd/icecast, or integrated flash player. multiple ampache servers can
be linked together using xml-rpc. the software is fully localized in many
languages.
