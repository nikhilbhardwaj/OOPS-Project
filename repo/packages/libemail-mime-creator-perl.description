Transitional dummy package for now-defunct email::mime::creator
	
email::mime is an extension of the email::simple module for easily handling
mime-encoded messages. it takes a message as a string, splits it up into its
constituent parts, and allows you access to various parts of the message.
headers are decoded from mime encoding.

this is a transitional dummy package which can be safely removed after the
upgrade. the email::mime::creator module is now part of email::mime.
