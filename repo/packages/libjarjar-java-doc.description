Repackage third-party jars - documentation
	
utility that makes it easy to repackage java libraries and embed them
into your own distribution. this is useful for two reasons:


 - you can easily ship a single jar file with no external dependencies.
 - you can avoid problems where your library depends on a specific
   version of a library, which may conflict with the dependencies of
   another library.


this package includes the documentation.
