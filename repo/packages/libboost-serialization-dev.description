Serialization library for c++ (default version)
	
this package forms part of the boost c++ libraries collection,
containing the following functionalities:


 * proper restoration of pointers to shared data
 * serialization of stl containers and other commonly used templates
 * data portability - streams of bytes created on one platform should
   be readable on any other
 * archive interface must be rich enough to permit the creation of an
   archive that presents serialized data as xml in a useful manner


here, "serialization" means the reversible deconstruction of an
arbitrary set of c++ data structures to a sequence of bytes.
archive: to refer to a specific rendering of this stream of bytes.

this package is a dependency package, which depends on debian's default
boost version (currently 1.42).
