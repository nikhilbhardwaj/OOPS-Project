Perl module for a sax2 xml writer
	
xml::sax::writer helps to serialize sax2 representations of xml documents to
strings, files, and other flat representations. it handles charset encodings,
xml escaping conventions, and so forth. it is still considered alpha,
although it has been put to limited use in settings such as xml::libxml and
the axkit xml application server.
