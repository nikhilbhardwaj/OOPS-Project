Easy, automatic, specification-based testing system
	
test::lectrotest provides a simple (yet full featured) interface to
lectrotest, an automated, specification-based testing system for perl.
to use it, declare properties that specify the expected behavior
of your software.  lectrotest then checks your software to see whether
those properties hold.
