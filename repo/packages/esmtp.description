User configurable relay-only mta
	
esmtp is a user configurable relay-only mail transfer agent (mta) with a
sendmail-compatible syntax. it's based on libesmtp supporting the auth
(including the cram-md5 and ntlm sasl mechanisms) and the starttls smtp
extensions.

esmtp does not receive mail, expand aliases or manage a queue but can deliver
mail locally via an mda.

this package contains the esmtp program.
