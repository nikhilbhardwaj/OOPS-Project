Java user interface toolkit
	
buoy is a java framework for creating user interfaces.

buoy is built on top of swing, but provides a completely new set of classes
to represent user interface elements. it has many advantages over using swing
directly, including a cleaner and simpler api, a far more powerful event
handling mechanism, a better system for laying out components, and built in
support for serializing and reconstructing user interfaces as xml.
