Socks wrapper for users behind a firewall
	
dante is a circuit-level firewall/proxy that can be used to provide
convenient and secure network connectivity to a wide range of hosts
while requiring only the server dante runs on to have external network
connectivity.

this package provides the "socksify" client program - a tool which
forwards network requests from any program to a socks server (v4 or v5)
which then performs them on your behalf.
