Classic-analog (vcos-vcf-vca) style software synthesizer
	
the xsynth-dssi  package contains the xsynth-dssi plugin, a classic-analog
(vcos-vcf-vca) style software synthesizer with an editor gui. xsynth-dssi was
written by sean bolton, and was based on steve brooke's xsynth code, but has
since acquired polyphonic operation, band-limited oscillators, a better
filter mode, and velocity-sensitive envelopes.

dssi is an api for audio processing plugins, particularly useful for software
synthesis plugins with user interfaces.
