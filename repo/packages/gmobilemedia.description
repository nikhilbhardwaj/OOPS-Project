Gtk+ application used to browse a mobile phone filesystem
	
gmobilemedia is a simple gtk+ application used to browse and handle a mobile
phone filesystem. it can handle phones with more than one memory area (thanks
to gammu). it lets you easily upload and download images, ringtones, photos,
and applications to/from your mobile phone. all you need is a data cable or
any other connection method supported by gammu.
