Unicode bidi algorithm for perl using libfribidi
	
text::bidi provides basic support for the unicode bidirectional text
(bidi) algorithm, for displaying text consisting of both left-to-right and
right-to-left written languages (like hebrew and arabic.) it does so using a
swig interface file to the libfribidi library.
