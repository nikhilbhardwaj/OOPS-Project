Multimedia key support as a pygtk object
	
this module lets you access multimedia keys found on most new keyboards
from python; most important it grabs all input events so your program
doesn't need to be in focus when the key is pressed (which is the
usual behavior of the keys). you still need something like acme or
xmodmap to map the keys before using them.
