Jabber relay bot
	
nagzilla was designed to be a jabber relay "bot" in that it sits quietly in a
room until it gets a message to relay to either a chatroom or a person. it is
split into two programs:

 * nagzillad - the daemon that sits in the room and sends the messages, and
 * nagzillac - the client that gets the messages and hands them to the daemon
