Python module for id3-tags manipulation
	
python-id3 is a simple python module for retrieving and setting so-called id3
tags on mp3 compressed audio files through an object-oriented interface. mp3
players generally use this simple information for display track title, artist
name, and album title while playing the sound file.

id3.py supports id3 version 1.1, including the track number field.
