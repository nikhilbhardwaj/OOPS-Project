Checker of html errors in strings or files
	
html::lint is a pure-perl html parser and checker for syntactic legitmacy.

the "weblint" script - provided in the separate package "weblint-perl" -
is a wrapper around the html::lint.

you can also look into apache::lint which is a mod_perl wrapper around
html::lint.

finally, for those of you doing automated testing with test::more and
its brethren, test::html::lint lets you automate html checking.
