Libmrml development files
	
mrml's aims are to unify access to multimedia retrieval and management
software component in order to extend their capabilities. the success
of such a context has already been demonstrated via the development of
the gnu image finding tool (gift).

the gift (the gnu image-finding tool) is a content based image
retrieval system (cbirs). it enables you to do query by example on
images, giving you the opportunity to improve query results by
relevance feedback. for processing your queries the program relies
entirely on the content of the images, freeing you from the need
to annotate all images before querying the collection.

the gift is an open framework. the communication protocol for
client-server communication, mrml, is xml based and fully documented.
