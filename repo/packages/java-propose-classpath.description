Helper script to suggest a classpath for jar files
	
java-propose-classpath analyzes a set of jar files and the installed
jars on the system to suggest a correct classpath for use with
jh_classpath/jh_manifest

this package should not be in any build-depends since java-propose-classpath
cannot be run automatically.
