Python libraries for interacting with openoffice.org
	
this is a python module to interact with openoffice.org. it aims to support:


 * users writing complex macros for openoffice in python
 * developers interacting with openoffice from outside (eg. use openoffice to
   print a file)


the library is designed to support both writing macros (called by ooo) and
interacting with ooo from an external python program (using the uno bridge).
