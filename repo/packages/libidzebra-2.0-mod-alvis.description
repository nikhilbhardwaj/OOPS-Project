this package includes the alvis filter which uses libxslt1 to
transform xml records by xslt into xml indexable records.
deprecated, better use the libidzebra-2.0-mod-dom indexing filter.

idzebra is a high-performance, general-purpose structured text indexing
and retrieval engine. it reads structured records in a variety of input
formats (eg. email, xml, marc) and allows access to them through exact
boolean search expressions and relevance-ranked free-text queries.
