Command line cd/dvd/bd writing tool
	
cdrskin strives to be a second source for the services traditionally
provided by cdrecord.
currently it does cd-r and cd-rw this way.  overwriteable media dvd-ram,
dvd+rw, dvd-rw, and bd-re are handled differently than with cdrecord-prodvd
in order to offer tao-like single track recording. sequential dvd-r[w],
dvd+r, dvd+r dl are handled like cd-r[w] with tao and multi-session.
additionally cdrskin offers cdrecord-prodvd-like mode dao with dvd-r[w].
