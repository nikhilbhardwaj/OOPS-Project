Thai word segmentation program
	
swath is a general-purpose utility for analyzing word boundaries in thai
text and inserting predefined word delimiter codes. it can be used as a
filter for thai latex files so the lines are wrapped properly when processed
with thailatex macros. other formats that swath can also handle include html,
rtf and plain text.
