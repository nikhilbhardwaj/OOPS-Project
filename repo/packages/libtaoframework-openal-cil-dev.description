Tao cli binding for openal - development files
	
the tao framework is a collection of bindings and libraries to
facilitate cross-platform games-related development utilizing the mono
and .net platforms.

openal, the open audio library, is a joint effort to create an open,
vendor-neutral, cross-platform api for interactive, primarily spatialized
audio. openal's primary audience are application developers and desktop
users that rely on portable standards like opengl, for games and other
multimedia applications.

this package contains development files for tao.openal and should be used
for compilation.
