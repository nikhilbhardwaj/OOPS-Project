Objective-c framework for socket programming with gnustep (libs)
	
netclasses is an easy to use interface to socket programming in objective-c
with gnustep. the core netclasses supports virtually any protocol, but the
distribution comes with everything needed for tcp/ip (opening ports,
background connections, etc.). netclasses seamlessly integrates into
nsrunloop, which means there should be no need for redesigning applications
to use it.

this package contains the library files.
