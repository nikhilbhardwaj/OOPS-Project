Coin-or linear programming solver
	
vol (volume algorithm) is a linear programming solver based on the
subgradient method.

vol is part of coin-or (computational infrastructure for operations
research) project which is an initiative to spur the development of
open-source software in operational research - mathematical optimization
algorithms.

this package contains the documentation and examples.
