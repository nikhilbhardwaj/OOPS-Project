Client/server based media player system
	
xmms2 is a redesign of the xmms music player. it features a client-server
model, allowing multiple (even simultaneous!) user interfaces, both textual
and graphical. all common audio formats are supported using plug-ins. on top of
this, there is a flexible media library to organize your music.

this package is a metapackage depending on various other xmms2 packages.
installing this package gets you a command line client and enables xmms2
playback of ogg vorbis and mp3 files from local and remote sources.
