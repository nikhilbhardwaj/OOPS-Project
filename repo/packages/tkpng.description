Png photo image support to tcl/tk
	
tkpng is an open source binary package that adds png photo image support
to tcl/tk. although other extensions such as img also add support for png
images, this package was designed to be lightweight, not depending on
libpng nor implementing other image formats, and suitable for inclusion in
the tk core.
