Documentation about ntfs partitions format
	
this work is derived from the linux-ntfs project
(http://linux-ntfs.sf.net/), that aims to bring full support for the
ntfs filesystem to the linux operating system.

this is a set of documents about all the ntfs internals (all the
publicly known internals) and the ntfs journal file format.
