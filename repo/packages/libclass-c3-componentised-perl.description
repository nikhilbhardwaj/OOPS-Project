Perl module to load mix-ins or components to c3-based classes
	
class::c3::componentised will inject base classes to your module using the
class::c3 method resolution order.

please note: these are not plugins that can take precedence over methods
declared in mymodule. if you want something like that, consider
moosex::object::pluggable.
