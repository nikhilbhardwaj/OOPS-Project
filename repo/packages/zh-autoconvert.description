autoconvert is an intelligent chinese encoding converter. it uses
builtin functions to judge the type of the input file's chinese
encoding (such as gb/big5/hz), then converts the input file to any
type of chinese encoding you want. you can use autoconvert to handle
incoming mail, automatically converting messages to the chinese
encoding you want.
it can alse handle unicode/utf7/utf8 now.
