python application designed for *nix environments that retrieves nzb files and
fully processes them. the goal being to make getting files from usenet as
hands-free as possible. once fully installed, all thats required is moving an
nzb file to the queue directory. the rest; fetching, par-checking, un-raring,
etc. is taken care of by hellanzb.
