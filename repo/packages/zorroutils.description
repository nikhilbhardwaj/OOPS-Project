Zorro bus utilities for amigas running 2.1 and later kernels
	
this package includes a program called "lszorro" that translates the
/proc/bus/zorro hierarchy into human-readable form; it replaces the
functionality from the /proc/zorro file provided under linux 2.0 and
below.

this package is only useful on amiga computers using autoconfig
(however, it works on systems without the zorro bus, despite the name).
