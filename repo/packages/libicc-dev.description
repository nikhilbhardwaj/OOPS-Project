Development files for the icc profile i/o library
	
the icclib is a set of routines which implement the reading and
writing of color profile files that conform to the international
color consortium (icc) profile format specification, version 3.4.

this package is needed to compile programs against libicc2.10, as
it only includes the header files and static libraries (optionally)
needed for compiling.
