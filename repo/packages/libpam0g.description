Pluggable authentication modules library
	
contains the c shared library for linux-pam, a suite of shared
libraries that enable the local system administrator to choose how
applications authenticate users.  in other words, without rewriting
or recompiling a pam-aware application, it is possible to switch
between the authentication mechanism(s) it uses.  one may entirely
upgrade the local authentication system without touching the
applications themselves.
