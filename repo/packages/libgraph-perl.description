Perl module for graph data structures and algorithms
	
this module contains the graph module for perl, a framework for
creating abstract data structures called graphs and hypergraphs.
(it is not for drawing any sort of graphics; for that, see the
gd:: or graphics:: set of modules.) it also contains implementations
of several well-known algorithms that operate on graphs, such as
finding transitive closures, strongly connected components
(sccs) and articulation points.
