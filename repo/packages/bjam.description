Software build tool
	
boost.jam (bjam) is a portable build tool with its own interpreted language,
which allows to implement rather complex logic in a readable way and without
resorting to external programs. it is a descendant of jam/mr tool modified to
suit the needs of boost.build. in particular, modules and rule parameters
were added, as well as several new builtins.
