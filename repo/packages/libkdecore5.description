The kde platform core library
	
all kde applications use this library to provide basic functionality such as
the configuration system, ipc, internationalization and locale support,
site-independent access to the filesystem and a large number of other (but no
less important) things. the classes in this library does not require linkage
to qtgui or any other library that requires a graphical interface.

this package is part of the kde development platform libraries module.
