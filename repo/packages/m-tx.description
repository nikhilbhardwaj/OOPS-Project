A simple music-from-text language for use with pmx/musixtex
	
m-tx is a preprocessor for pmx (which is, in turn, a musixtex preprocessor)
that facilitates inputting lyrics. it builds the pmx input file based on a
language very similar to pmx. m-tx includes most of pmx's functionality, but it
also permits in-line pmx commands to give access to virtually all of pmx.
