File-finding iterator
	
file::next is an iterator-based module for finding files.  it's
lightweight, has no dependencies, runs under taint mode, and puts your
program more directly in control of file selection.

it's taken heavily from mark jason dominus' excellent book "higher
order perl".  http://hop.perl.plover.com/
