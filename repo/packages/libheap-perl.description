Perl extensions for keeping data partially sorted
	
the heap collection of modules provide routines that manage
a heap of elements.  a heap is a partially sorted structure
that is always able to easily extract the smallest of the
elements in the structure (or the largest if a reversed compare
routine is provided).

if the collection of elements is changing dynamically, the
heap has less overhead than keeping the collection fully
sorted.
