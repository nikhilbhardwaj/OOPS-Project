Zynaddsubfx engines converted to lv2 plugin format
	
the zyn project main goal is to extract synth engines from zynaddsubfx
and pack them in lv2 plugin format. resulting plugins are heavily
based on work made by nasca octavian paul. if you like the amazing
sounds these plugins generate you should thank paul for this.
