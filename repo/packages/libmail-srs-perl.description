Interface to sender rewriting scheme
	
the sender rewriting scheme preserves .forward functionality in an
spf-compliant world.

spf requires the smtp client ip to match the envelope sender
(return-path). when a message is forwarded through an intermediate
server, that intermediate server may need to rewrite the return-path
to remain spf compliant. if the message bounces, that intermediate
server needs to validate the bounce and forward the bounce to the
original sender.
