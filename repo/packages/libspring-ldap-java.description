Java library for simpler ldap programming
	
spring ldap is built on the same principles as the jdbctemplate in spring
jdbc. it completely eliminates the need to worry about creating and closing
ldapcontext and looping through namingenumeration. it also provides a
more comprehensive unchecked exception hierarchy, built on spring's
dataaccessexception. as a bonus, it also contains classes for dynamically
building ldap filters and dns (distinguished names), ldap attribute
management, and client-side ldap transaction management.
