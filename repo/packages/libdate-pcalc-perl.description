Perl module for gregorian calendar date calculations
	
this package consists of a perl module for all kinds of date calculations
based on the gregorian calendar (the one used in all western countries today),
thereby complying with all relevant norms and standards: iso/r 2015-1971, din
1355 and, to some extent, iso 8601 (where applicable).

this module is a direct translation of steffen beyer's excellent date::calc
module to perl.
