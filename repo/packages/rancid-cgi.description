Looking glass cgi for rancid
	
this is a popular isp toolkit, based on expect and shell scripts,
for managing router configurations.
rancid monitors a router's (or device's) configuration, including
software and hardware (cards, serial numbers, etc), using cvs.
rancid currently supports cisco routers, juniper routers, catalyst
switches, foundry switches, redback nass, and adc ezt3 muxes.
this is the cgi package, a modified version of lg (looking glass)
provided from rancid team to check rancid through web interface too.
