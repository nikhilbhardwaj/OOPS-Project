Recursively copy perl datatypes
	
the clone module provides a clone() method which makes recursive copies of
nested hash, array, scalar and reference types, including tied variables and
objects.

it is faster (although less flexible) than storable's dclone. its
functionality is _not_ serializing in-memory objects (i.e. as
data::dumper or yaml::dump do), but deep-copying them over to new
in-memory structures.
