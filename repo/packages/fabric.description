Simple pythonic remote deployment tool
	
fabric is designed to upload files and run shell commands on a number of
servers in parallel or serially. these commands are grouped in tasks (which
are regular python functions) and specified in a 'fabfile.'

it is similar to capistrano, except it's implemented in python and doesn't
expect you to be deploying rails applications.
