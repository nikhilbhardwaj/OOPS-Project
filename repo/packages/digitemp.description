Read temperature sensors in a 1-wire net
	
digitemp is a program that reads data coming from a 1-wire network using
a passive adapter (ds9097) or the newer active adapter (ds9097u),
connected to a serial port. it also supports reading from usb adaptors
like the ds2490. basically it reads temperature sensors, but others
are supported, like a humidity sensor.

digitemp also supports branched networks using ds2409 couplers.
