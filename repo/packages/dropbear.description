Lightweight ssh2 server and client
	
dropbear is a ssh 2 server and client designed to be small enough to
be used in small memory environments, while still being functional and
secure enough for general use.

it implements most required features of the ssh 2 protocol, and other
features such as x11 and authentication agent forwarding.
