Performance monitor unit (pmu) -- development files
	
this package contains the all developments files for the libpfm3
library which is used by performance monitoring applications using
the ia-64 performance monitor unit (pmu).  this version supports
several modern processors: both the itanium and itanium 2 processors,
as well as pentium m/p6 cores, and amd x86_64 processors.

header files are no longer in /usr/include/perfmon3.  since libpfm support
for 2.4 linux kernels has been deprecated, the header files have been moved
back to their original upstream location of /usr/include/perfmon.
