Module to compile and link c code for perl modules
	
extutils::cbuilder is a utility to portably build c code by invoking the
appropriate compilers and linkers. it provides a cross-platform way to build
perl xs modules, which contain c code that needs to be built and dynamically
linked to perl.

though motivated by the module::build project, it may be useful for other
purposes as well. however, this module is not intended as a general interface
for all c building needs.
