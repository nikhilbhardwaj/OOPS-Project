Initramfs extension for bootcd
	
with the installation of this bootcd extension your
initrd-image will be updated to be usable for bootcd.
with bootcd you can copy your system to cd, run it from cd without need for
disks and restore your system on disk from bootcd.
this package should be installed on a system you want to copy to cd, if the
kernel uses initrd (as all prebuild debian 2.4 and 2.6 kernels do).
if you have also installed discover than it can be used to detect the needed
modules to boot.
