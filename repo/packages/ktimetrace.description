Graphical tool to measure and graph data
	
ktimetrace is a graphical tool based on qt that measures and
displays data from data acquisition hardware.  it captures
samples from a data acquisition device, saving it to disk
while providing a real-time graphing display.

ktimetrace requires having a data acquisition device that is
supported by comedi in order to capture data.  see the libcomedi0
package or http://stm.lbl.gov/comedi for more information about
