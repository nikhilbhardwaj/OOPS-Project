Bitcard authentication plugin
	
jifty::plugin::authentication::bitcard replaces jifty::plugin::user, and
jifty::plugin::authentication::password, since bitcard handles all the heavy
lifting for us.

user logins are handled through bitcard.

caution: this plugin has not been thoroughly tested in the wild.
