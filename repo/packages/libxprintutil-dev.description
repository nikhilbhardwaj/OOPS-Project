Xprint printer utility client library (development files)
	
libxprintutil provides utility xpu apis allowing client applications
to access and manipulate information about printer capabilities
from an xprint server.

if you want to write an app to create xprint jobs (printing x windows
to paper, for instance) then you probably want libxp-dev instead.

this package provides a static library and c header files.
