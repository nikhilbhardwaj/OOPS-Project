Multi dimension data structure library -- headers
	
a collection of multi-dimensional data structure and indexing algorithm.

this is a c++ library, and is a collection of various data structures designed
to efficiently store and query multi-dimensional data for various
filtering criteria. different structures are optimized for different
query needs.

this library is a source-code only library. itâ€™s designed to be
header-only meaning that the user program does not need to link to any
additional shared library in order to use these data structures. the
data structures are all available as c++ templates.
