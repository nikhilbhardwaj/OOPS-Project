Buffering/reblocking program for tape backups, printing, etc.
	
buffer implements double buffering and can be used to keep backup tapes
streaming or printers printing. it can also be used to convert a data
stream to a given output blocksize.

buffer uses shared memory to convert a variable input data rate to a
constant output data rate. it is typically used in a pipe between a backup
program and the tape device, but there are also other applications like
buffering printer data in lpd's input filter.
