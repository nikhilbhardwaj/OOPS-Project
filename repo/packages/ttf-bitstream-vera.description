The bitstream vera family of free truetype fonts
	
this is a set of high-quality truetype fonts created by bitstream, inc. and
released under a dfsg-free license. they are intended to remedy the lack of
free high-quality fonts for the free desktop environments.

they fully cover western european languages (iso-8859-1, iso-8859-15) and
turkish (iso-8859-9). they also include a selection of mathematical and other
symbols and some limited support for eastern european languages (parts of
iso-8859-2). non-latin scripts are not supported (use ttf-dejavu instead).
