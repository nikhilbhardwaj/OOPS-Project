Convert data between marc and dublin core
	
this module provides an implentation of the loc's spec on how to convert
metadata between marc and dublin core format. the spec for converting marc to
dublin core is available at: http://www.loc.gov/marc/marc2dc.html, and from dc
to marc: http://www.loc.gov/marc/dccross.html.

nb: the conversion cannot be done in a round-trip manner. i.e. doing a
conversion from marc to dc, then trying to go back to marc will not yield the
original record.
