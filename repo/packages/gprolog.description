Gnu prolog compiler
	
gnu prolog is a free prolog compiler with constraint solving over finite
domains (fd) developed at inria by daniel diaz.  gnu prolog is based on two
systems developed by the same author (with lot of code rewriting and a lot of
new extensions): wamcc and clp(fd).  much work has been devoted to make it
iso compatible, full compliance being one of its goals.

this package contains the compiler and runtime system for the iso
standard version of gnu prolog.
