A minimal lightweight exception class
	
this module implements a minimal lightweight exception object. it is meant to
be a compromise between more basic solutions like carp which can only print
information and cannot handle exception objects, and more more complex
solutions like exception::class which can be used to define complex inline
exceptions and has a number of module dependencies.
