Python mode for gnu emacs and xemacs
	
provides a major mode for gnu emacs and xemacs to edit, debug, and develop
python programs and doctests.

if you install this with xemacs 21, it will replace the included
python-mode.el, which may or may not be a more recent version
(use "c-h v py-version" to compare).

since this package automagically loads after python mode shipped with
gnu emacs >= 22, installation of this package makes python-mode's
mode the default for editing python code in emacs.
