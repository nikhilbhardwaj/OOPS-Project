Buzztard - support plugins for gstreamer (development files)
	
gstreamer is a streaming media framework, based on graphs of filters
which operate on media data.  applications using this library can do
anything from real-time sound processing to playing videos, and just
about anything else media-related.  its plugin-based architecture means
that new data types or processing capabilities can be added simply by
installing new plug-ins.

the buzztard project aims to provide a modular, free, open source music
studio that is conceptually based on the proprietary windows software
called buzz. the buzztard project itself has no direct link to buzz
apart from its concepts that we build upon and is no 1:1 buzz copy.
to allow migration for buzz users, buzztard provides song-file import
and buzz-machine reuse.

this package contains development files.
