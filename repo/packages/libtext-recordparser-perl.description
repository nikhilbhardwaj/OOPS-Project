Module to parse record-oriented data in a text file
	
text::recordparser is a perl module that extracts record-oriented data from
arbitrary text files. the most common example has records separated by
newlines and fields delimited by commas or tabs. this module aims to provide
a consistent interface for processing an arbitrary sequence of records in a
file, however they may be delimited. the data can then be extracted using
arrays or hashes.
