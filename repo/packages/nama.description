Ecasound-based multitrack recorder/mixer
	
nama is a text-based application for multitrack
recording, mixing and mastering using the ecasound
audio engine developed by kai vehmanen.

features include tracks, buses, effects, presets,
sends, inserts, marks and regions. nama runs under jack and
alsa audio frameworks, automatically detects ladspa plugins,
and supports ladish level 1 session handling.

all editing under nama is non-destructive. effects are
generally applied in realtime. a track caching (track
freezing) function is also available.

the command prompt accepts nama commands, ecasound
interactive-mode commands, shell commands and perl code,
providing command history and autocompletion.  the help
system covers internal commands and ladspa effects and
includes keyword search.

by default, nama displays a simple graphic interface while
the command processor runs in a terminal window. the -t
option provides a text-only interface for console users.
