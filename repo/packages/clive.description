Video extraction utility for youtube, google video and others
	
clive is a command line utility for extracting videos from youtube and other
video sharing web sites. it was originally written to bypass the adobe flash
requirement needed to view the hosted videos. it is non-interactive, meaning
it can work in the background while the user is not logged on. this allows the
user to start an extraction and disconnect from the system, letting clive
finish the work.
