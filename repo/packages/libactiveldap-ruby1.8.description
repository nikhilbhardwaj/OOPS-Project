An object-oriented interface to ldap for ruby
	
activeldap is a wrapper around ruby/ldap with its interface inspired
by activerecord (from the rails project).

it dynamically parses the ldap serverâ€™s schema based on the
objectclasses an entry has. it then exposes the ldap attributes as
methods on the object. this means that if you update the objectclass
on an object, the methods/attributes available for changing are
automatically updated.
