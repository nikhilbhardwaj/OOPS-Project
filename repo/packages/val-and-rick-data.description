Shooter game - game data
	
val & rick is probably the precursor to gunroar, featuring similar controls
but in a different environment. only 2d sprites and backgrounds are used in
what seems like a tribute to xevious and star soldier.

this package includes the architecture-independent data for kenta cho's game
val & rick.
