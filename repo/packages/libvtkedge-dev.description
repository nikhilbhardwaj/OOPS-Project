Library of advanced visualization and data processing techniques - development
	
vtkedge is a library of advanced visualization and data processing techniques
that complement the visualization toolkit (vtk), as well as custom modules to
allow the use of these techniques within paraview. vtkedge does not replace
vtk, but rather is built alongside vtk to provide additional functionality.
vtkedge is available either as open source under the gplv3 licensing terms, or
as a commercial product. this new toolkit was created by kitware in order to
provide the open source visualization community with access to some of our
latest technology, while still meeting the commercialization requirements of
the government contracts that funded the research and development effort.

this package contains the development files needed to build your own
vtkedge applications.
