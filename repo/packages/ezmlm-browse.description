Web browser for ezmlm-idx archives
	
this is ezmlm-browse, a web interface for browsing ezmlm-idx (version
0.40 or later) archives.  the default presentation is similar to that
of the ezmlm-cgi archive browser that is part of ezmlm-idx, but with
the addition of threaded subjects and online posting / replying.
however, the output is completely template drive, so you can make it
fit into your current web scheme.
