Personal dashboard for gnustep
	
this is a free replacement of serence's proprietary klipfolio
application.  plopfolio supports klips available from klipfarm
(http://klipfarm.com).  plopfolio is developed using the objective-c
language and works well with gnustep (on gnu/linux, freebsd, and
more) and cocoa on mac os x.
