Image manipulation library
	
the magickwand api is the recommended interface between the c programming
language and the imagemagick image processing libraries. unlike the
magickcore c api, magickwand uses only a few opaque types. accessors are
available to set or get important wand properties.

this package contains the c libraries needed to run executables that make
use of magickwand.
