A priority queue extension for python
	
this c extension implements a priority-queue object using a fibonacci
heap as the underlying data structure.  it supports insertion,
deletion, and reprioritization of entries.

all operations are o(log n) or faster; insertion and finding the
lowest-priority item are o(1).
