Perl c/xs module to process comma-separated value files
	
text::csv_xs provides facilities for the composition and decomposition of
comma-separated values. this module can combine fields into a csv string and,
correspondingly, parse a csv string back into fields.

text::csv (see libtext-csv-perl) is a wrapper module which will automatically
select the most appropriate implementation for your configuration.
