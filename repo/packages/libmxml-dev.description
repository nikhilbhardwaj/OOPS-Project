Small xml parsing library (development)
	
mini-xml is a small xml parsing library that you can use to read xml and
xml-like data files in your application without requiring large non-standard
libraries.

mini-xml provides the following functionality:

 * reading of utf-8 and utf-16 and writing of utf-8 encoded xml files and
   strings.
 * data is stored in a linked-list tree structure, preserving the xml data
   hierarchy.
 * supports arbitrary element names, attributes, and attribute values with
   no preset limits, just available memory.
 * supports integer, real, opaque ("cdata"), and text data types in "leaf"
   nodes.
 * functions for creating, indexing, and managing trees of data.
 * "find" and "walk" functions for easily locating and navigating trees of
   data.



 this package contains the mini-xml development files.
