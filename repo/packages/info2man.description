Convert gnu info files to pod or man pages
	
this package provides the info2pod tool to convert gnu info documents into
perl's pod (plain old documentation) format. from there, they can be
converted to manual pages to be viewed by people who prefer conventional
pagers to the standard info viewer or emacs.

the info2man tool uses info2pod and pod2man to perform the conversion in
one step.
