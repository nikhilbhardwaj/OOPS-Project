Gnu common lisp compiler
	
gnu common lisp (gcl) is a common lisp compiler and interpreter
implemented in c, and complying mostly with the standard set
forth in the book "common lisp, the language i".  it attempts
to strike a useful middle ground in performance and portability
from its design around c.

this package contains the lisp system itself.  documentation
is provided in the gcl-doc package.
