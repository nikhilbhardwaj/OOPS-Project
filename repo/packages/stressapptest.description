Stress test application for simulating high load situations
	
stressful application test (or stressapptest, its unix name) tries to maximize
randomized traffic to memory from processor and i/o, with the intent of
creating a realistic high load situation in order to test the existing hardware
devices in a computer.

stressapptest may be used for various purposes:

 * stress test
 * hardware qualification and debugging
 * memory interface test
 * disk testing
