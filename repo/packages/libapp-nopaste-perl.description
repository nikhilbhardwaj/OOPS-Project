Application for easy access to any pastebin
	
app::nopaste is a perl module and application collection to upload arbitrary
text, usually code, to pastebins (also known as nopaste sites) for public
viewing. they're used a lot in irc channels to show code that would normally
be too long to give directly in the channel.

each pastebin is slightly different; this program attempts to encapsulate the
differences between them and provide a unified, redundant interface to upload
code. if one site doesn't work, it simply tries a different one.
