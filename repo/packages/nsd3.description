Authoritative domain name server (3.x series)
	
nsd3 is a fast, authoritative only, high performance, simple
and open source name server.

nsd was primarily developed by nlnet labs on request from and in close
cooperation with ripe ncc, as an alternative name server software to be
run on the root name server ripe ncc operates.

note: 3.x configuration is not backward compatible with the 2.x series,
but lives in /etc/nsd3 so it won't overwrite your nsd 2.x one.
