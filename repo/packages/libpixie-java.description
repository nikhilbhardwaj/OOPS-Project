Java vector format viewer library
	
pixie is a wmf-file reading library originally written as converter for the
pixie-imageviewer. pixie was long time dead and is now resurrected as
wmf-reader and imageproducer for java 1.2.2 or higher.

pixie lacks the support for most bitmap-formats but everything else is
working fine. write-support will be implemented somewhere in the future,
classes for the writesupport are mostly dummies at the moment.
