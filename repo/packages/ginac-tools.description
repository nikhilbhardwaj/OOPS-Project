Some tools for the ginac symbolic framework
	
ginac (which stands for "ginac is not a cas (computer algebra system)") is a
library for doing symbolic (i.e. non-numeric) computation directly in the c++
programming language.

this package provides some additional tools, like the popular ginsh (ginac
interactive shell) and viewgar (for inspecting ginac archive files).
