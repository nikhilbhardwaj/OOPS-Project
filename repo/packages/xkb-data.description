X keyboard extension (xkb) configuration data
	
this package contains configuration data used by the x keyboard
extension (xkb), which allows selection of keyboard layouts when
using a graphical interface.

every x11 vendor provides its own xkb data files, so keyboard layout
designers have to send their layouts to several places.  the
xkeyboard-config project has been launched at freedesktop in order
to provide a central repository that could be used by all vendors.
