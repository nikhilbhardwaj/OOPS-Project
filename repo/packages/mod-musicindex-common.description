Common files for mod-musicindex
	
mod_musicindex is aimed at being a c alternative to the perl module
apache::mp3 (http://search.cpan.org/dist/apache-mp3/).
it allows nice displaying of directories containing mp3 or ogg vorbis and
flac files, including sorting them on various fields, streaming/downloading
them, constructing playlists and searching.

this package includes platform independent data for libapache2-mod-musicindex
and is useless without it.
