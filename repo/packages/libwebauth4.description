Shared libraries for webauth authentication
	
webauth is a cookie-based web authentication system built on top of
kerberos.  it relies on a central authentication server that handles all
user authentication for a domain and creates user authentication
credentials for any web server that needs strong authentication.

this package contains the shared library used by the webauth modules,
perl bindings, and command-line utilities.  it does token encoding and
decoding and other lower-level parts of the webauth protocol.
