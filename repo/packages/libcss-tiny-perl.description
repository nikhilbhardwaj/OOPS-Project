Perl module to read/write .css files with as little code as possible
	
css::tiny is a perl class to read and write .css stylesheets with as
little code as possible, reducing load time and memory overhead.
css.pm requires about 2.6m of memory to load, which is a large amount of
overhead if you only want to do trivial things.

this module is primarily for reading and writing simple files, and anything
you write shouldn't need to have documentation/comments. if you need something
with more power, move up to css.pm.
