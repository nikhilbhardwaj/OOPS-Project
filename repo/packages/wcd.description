Saves time typing when you want to change directories
	
wcd (wherever change directory) is a program to quickly change directories.
it saves time typing at the keyboard. one needs to type only a part of a
directory name and wcd will jump to it. by default, wcd searches for a
directory with a name that begins with what has been typed, but the use of
wildcards is also fully supported.
