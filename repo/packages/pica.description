pica is the perl installation and configuration agent.
it allows a system administrator to copy files from a
centralized source to their servers, customizing every copy
with macros and conditionals in a pikt-like fashion (e.g.
depending on the target server).  it features remote
command execution and remote object diff, and has an alarm
framework available (pifia; see the picalib package).
