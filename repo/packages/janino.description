Runtime java compiler
	
janino is a compiler that reads a java expression, block, class body,
source file or a set of source files, and generates java bytecode that is
loaded and executed directly. janino is not intended to be a development tool,
but an embedded compiler for run-time compilation purposes, e.g. expression
evaluators or embedded code as with jsp.
