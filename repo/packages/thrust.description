A port of the classic commodore 64 game
	
the object of the game is to lift the klystron pod from
the bottom of a cave and return it safely to space. the
pod is very heavy (compared to the ship) and this makes it
tougher than it may seem.

you must be careful not to run out of fuel, crash into the
cave walls, or let the enemy artillery outposts shoot you
down.
