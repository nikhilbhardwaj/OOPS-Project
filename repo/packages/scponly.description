Restricts the commands available to scp- and sftp-users
	
"scponly" is an alternative 'shell' (of sorts) for system
administrators who would like to provide access to remote users to
both read and write local files without providing any remote
execution priviledges.  functionally, it is best described as a
wrapper to the mostly trusted suite of ssh applications.

this package has, for security reasons, no support for rsync,
unison or svn. if you want that, choose "scponly-full" instead.
