Generic interface for proof assistants - coq support
	
proof general is a major mode to turn emacs into an interactive proof
assistant to write formal mathematical proofs using a variety of
theorem provers. it works with either xemacs or gnu emacs.

this package provides the proof general support for the coq
theorem prover which is available as another package. the
package is however not required to just edit coq files.
