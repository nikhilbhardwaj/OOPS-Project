Desk calculator language
	
nickle is a language with powerful programming and scripting capabilities.
nickle supports a variety of datatypes, especially arbitrary precision
integers, rationals, and imprecise reals.  the input language vaguely
resembles c.  some things in c which do not translate easily are different,
some design choices have been made differently, and a very few features are
simply missing.
