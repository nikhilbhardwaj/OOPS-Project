mdns-scan is a tool for scanning for mdns/dns-sd services published
on the local network.

it works by issuing a mdns ptr query to the special rr
_services._dns-sd._udp.local for retrieving a list of all currently
registered services on the local link.

mdns/dns-sd is part of apple's zeroconf strategy (a.k.a. bonjour).
the avahi-daemon package is an implementation of mdns/dns-sd.
