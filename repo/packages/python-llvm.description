Python bindings for llvm
	
llvm-py provides python bindings for llvm, the low level virtual machine.
it's goal is to expose enough of llvm apis to implement a compiler backend
or a vm in pure python.

llvm-py consists of python and c modules that wrap over the native c++/c
bindings of llvm, and does not use / have dependencies on "glue utilities"
like boost.python, swig etc.
