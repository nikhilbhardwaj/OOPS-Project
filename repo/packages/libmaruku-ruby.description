A markdown-superset interpreter for ruby
	
maruku implements a superset of the markdown language, designed to
easily create html documents while only focusing on the high-level
structure and not the details. maruku also supports latex export,
which means you can produce pdf output.

maruku prides itself of being decently fast on long documents.

this package is a dependency package that pulls in the correct package
for the current default version of ruby.
