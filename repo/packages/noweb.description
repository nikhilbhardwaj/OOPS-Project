A web-like literate-programming tool
	
noweb is designed to meet the needs of literate programmers while
remaining as simple as possible.  its primary advantages are
simplicity, extensibility, and language-independence.

the noweb manual is only 3 pages; an additional page explains how to
customize its latex output.  noweb works ``out of the box'' with any
programming language, and supports tex, latex, and html back ends.

the primary sacrifice relative to web is that code is not
prettyprinted.
