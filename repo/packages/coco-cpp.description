Coco/r compiler generator (c++ version)
	
coco/r is a compiler generator, which takes an attributed grammar of a source
language and generates a scanner and a parser for this language. the scanner
works as a deterministic finite automaton. the parser uses recursive descent.
ll(1) conflicts can be resolved by a multi-symbol lookahead or by semantic
checks. thus the class of accepted grammars is ll(k) for an arbitrary k.

to start coco call cococpp, which is a shell script in /usr/bin.
