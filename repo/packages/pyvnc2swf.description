Screen recording tool with flash (swf) output
	
pyvnc2swf captures screen motion using the vnc protocol and generates
a shockwave flash (swf) movie which can be played back in any browser
supporting the swf format.

in contrast to vnc2swf, pyvnc2swf is being actively developed and has
more functions: recording and adding an audio track, editing and
adding a seekbar.
