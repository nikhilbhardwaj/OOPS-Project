Simple relay-only mail transport agent
	
nullmailer is a replacement mta for hosts, which relay to a fixed set of
smart relays. it is designed to be simple to configure and especially
useful on slave machines and in chroots.

the sendmail interface of this package doesn't provide the -bs switch,
hence it's not lsb compatible!
