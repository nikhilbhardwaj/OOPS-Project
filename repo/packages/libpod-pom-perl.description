Module providing a pod object model
	
pod::pom is a perl pod document parser that exposes an object model called
pod object model. the object model is generated as a hierarchical tree of
nodes, each of which represents a different element of the original document.
the tree can be walked manually and the nodes examined, printed or otherwise
manipulated. pod::pom also provides view objects, which can automatically
traverse the tree, or section thereof, and generate an output representation
in one form or another.
