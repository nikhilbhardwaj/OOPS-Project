Ssl/tls man-in-the-middle attack tool
	
sslsniff is designed to create man-in-the-middle (mitm) attacks for
ssl/tls connections, and dynamically generates certs for the domains
that are being accessed on the fly. the new certificates are constructed
in a certificate chain that is signed by any certificate that is
provided.
sslsniff also supports other attacks like null-prefix or ocsp attacks to
achieve silent interceptions of connections when possible.
