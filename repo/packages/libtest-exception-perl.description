Module for testing exception-based code
	
test::exception is a perl test module that provides a few convenience methods
for testing exception-based code. it is built with test::builder and plays
happily with test::more and friends.

note that this module only checks for exceptions, so it ignores other methods
of halting program executing - including exit(). if your code causes the perl
interpreter to exit, test::exception won't be able to catch it.
