Magnify part of x display, with real-time updates
	
like xmag, xzoom magnifies a section of the x display. xzoom is different
because it will continuously update the magnified area as the display
changes. it is fast enough to enlarge small animations, for example.

it can also mirror or rotate a part of the screen.
