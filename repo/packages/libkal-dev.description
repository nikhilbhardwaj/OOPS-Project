Library for converting dates between various calendar systems
	
the 'libkal' library provides support for converting dates between various
calendar systems (currently only julianic, gregorianic, arabic and jewish
ones) and some more related stuff.

the basic idea of this library is, that any date in any calendar system can be
converted to a single number, which express the number of days since some
fixed date in the past. libkal uses the so-called 'julianic date'(jd), that is
used in astronomy (not exactly).
