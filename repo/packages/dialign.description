Segment-based multiple sequence alignment
	
dialign2 is a command line tool to perform multiple alignment of
protein or dna sequences. it constructs alignments from gapfree pairs
of similar segments of the sequences. this scoring scheme for
alignments is the basic difference between dialign and other global or
local alignment methods. note that dialign does not employ any kind of
gap penalty. it has been published by morgenstern b. in
bioinformatics. 1999 mar;15(3):211-8.
