Perl modules for automatically generating debian packages
	
debian::package::make::* is a set of modules that simplify the
process of writing make-*-package programs (scripts that
automatically generate debian packages).

this is useful for source distributions where contents change too
frequently for manual building or where peculiar licenses prohibit
redistribution via public package repositories.
