Common c++ class framework for rtp packets
	
gnu ccrtp is a gnu common c++ based high performance rtp stack. rtp is
the internet-standard protocol for the transport of real-time data,
including audio and video. it can be used for media-on-demand as well
as interactive for creating services such as internet telephony.

gnu ccrtp offers support for rtcp and many other standard and extended
features that are needed for both compatible and advanced streaming
applications. gnu ccrtp can mix multiple payload types in stream, and
hence can be used to implement rfc 2833 compliant signaling applications
as well as other specialized things. gnu ccrtp also offers direct rtp
packet filtering.

gnu ccrtp is threadsafe and high performance. it uses packet queue
lists rather than streaming buffers. this allows ccrtp to be used to
create high capacity streaming servers as well as client applications.

gnu ccrtp is designed to support both audio and video data and can do
partial frame splits/re-assembly. gnu ccrtp also supports multicast
networks and multiple active connection sources. this allows its use
for building all forms of internet standards based audio and visual
conferencing systems.

gnu ccrtp uses templates and can be used to implement realtime
streaming with different underlying transport protocols, not just
with ipv4 udp sockets.
