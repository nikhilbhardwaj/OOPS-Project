Unique identifiers for python
	
mxuid provides a fast mechanism for generating universal
identification strings (uids) with intention of making these uids
unique with high probability in order to serve as object or data set
identifiers.

a typical use lies in generating session ids. other areas where
unique ids play an important role are rpc-implementations, orbs, user
identification, message passing systems, object databases, etc.
