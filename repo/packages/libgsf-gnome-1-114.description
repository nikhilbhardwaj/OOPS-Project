Structured file library - runtime version for gnome
	
the gnome structured file library aims to provide an efficient
extensible i/o abstraction for dealing with different structured file
formats.

this version of libgsf makes use of bonobo, gnome's corba-based component
architecture and of gnome-vfs, the gnome virtual file-system.
