Real-time audio resampling library - development files
	
a real-time library for audio sampling rate conversion providing
several useful features relative to resample-1.7 on which it is based:


 - more portable (source includes autoconf script and visual c++
   project file, packaging adds cmake script with shared library
   support).



 - memory-based (no need to read or write external files).



 - floating-point computations (not fixed-point).



 - faster and more accurate results (filter table increased by a factor
   of 32).



 - supports variable resampling ratio (data can be processed in small
   chunks).



 - easily applied to any number of simultaneous data channels



 - lgpl-licensed (libsamplerate, a gpl-licensed alternative, is
   considered by the libresample author to be technically superior).


this package contains the development headers and static libraries for
resample.
