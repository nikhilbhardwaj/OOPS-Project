Simple/symbolic calculation library (development files)
	
scalc is a c++ library for manipulation of mathematical
expressions. it is possible to define functions, either using an
expression or a c function. it is able to compute derivatives
analytically, and is therefore suitable for implementing non-linear
curve fitting with user-specified arbitrary functions.

this package contains the development files and the html
documentation.
