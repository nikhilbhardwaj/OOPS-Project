Type 1 font rasterizer library - development
	
t1lib is an enhanced rasterizer for type 1 fonts.

t1lib is based on the x11r5 font rasterizer code, but operates independently
of x11.  it includes many enhancements, including underlining, antialiasing,
user-defined slant and extension factors, and rotation.

this package contains the header files and static libraries needed to
develop programs using t1lib.
