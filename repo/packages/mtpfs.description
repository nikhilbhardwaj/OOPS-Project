Fuse filesystem for media transfer protocol devices
	
mtpfs is a fuse filesystem that supports reading and writing from mtp (media
transfer protocol) devices, such as mp3 players, video players or digital
cameras.

in addition to revealing media files on the connected device, mtpfs exposes a
virtual directory called "/playlists" which contains the device's playlists as
m3u files.
