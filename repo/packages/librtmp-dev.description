Toolkit for rtmp streams (development files)
	
a small dumper for media content streamed over the rtmp protocol (like bbc's
iplayer high quality streams). supplying an rtmp url will result in a dumped
flv file, which can be played/transcoded using ffmpeg/mplayer, etc.

this package contains the development libraries, header files needed by
programs that want to compile with librtmp.
