Minimal window manager written in c++
	
aewm++ is a minimal window manager for x11, based on aewm. it keeps aewm's
minimalist look and feel but is written in c++, and adds some modern features
like virtual desktops. gnome ewmh hints have been removed in this release,
because upstream wants to focus on making the code stable and minimalistic.

this package used to include appbar, aewm++_fspanel, setrootimage and
aewm++_xsession; these can now be found in the aewm++-goodies package.
