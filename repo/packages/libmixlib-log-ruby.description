A simple ruby mixin for creating a logger object
	
provides a class based object to provide logging. messages can be sent at
different levels such as warn or error. logging defaults to stdout but
can also be sent to a file with simple built in rotation.

this package is a dependency package, which depends on the package
containing actual ruby mixlib-log libraries for the default ruby version
(currently 1.8).
