Synchronous ruby amqp client
	
bunny is an amqp (advanced message queuing protocol) client, written in ruby,
that is intended to allow you to interact with amqp-compliant message
brokers/servers such as rabbitmq in a synchronous fashion.

this package is a dependency package, which depends on the package
containing actual ruby bunny libraries for the default ruby version
(currently 1.8).
