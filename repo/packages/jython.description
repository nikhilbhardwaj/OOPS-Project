Python seamlessly integrated with java
	
jython is an implementation of the high-level, dynamic, object-oriented
language python seamlessly integrated with the java platform.  the
predecessor to jython, jpython, is certified as 100% pure java.

jython is complementary to java and allows the two languages to be freely
mixed.  it is especially suited for embedded scripting, interactive
experimentation and rapid application development, and it can
interact with java packages or with running java applications.
