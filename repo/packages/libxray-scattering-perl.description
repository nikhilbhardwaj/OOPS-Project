X-ray scattering data for the elements
	
this module supports access to x-ray scattering data for atoms and ions.
it is designed to be a transparent interface to scattering data from a
variety of sources.  currently, the only sources of data are the cromer-mann
tables from the international tables of crystallography and the 1995
waasmaier-kirfel tables.  more resources can be added easily.
