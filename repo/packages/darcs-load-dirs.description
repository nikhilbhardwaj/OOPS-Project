Import upstream archives into darcs
	
darcs works fine for importing new archives.  however, for situations
where the upstream renames or moves files and directories on a regular
basis, version information can be lost.

darcs-load-dirs works with darcs to import these things and preserve
changes.  it works on a principle similar to subversion's
svn_load_dirs or tla_load_dirs package for arch.
