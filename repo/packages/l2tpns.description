Layer 2 tunnelling protocol network server (lns)
	
l2tpns is a daemon designed to terminate large volumes of layer 2
tunnelling protocol (rfc 2661: l2tp) sessions.

the daemon supports up to 65535 sessions plus features such as rate
limiting, walled garden, usage accounting, and clustering (for both
load-sharing and redundancy).

note that only the lns side of the l2tp protocol is implemented, for
a more complete l2tp implementation see the l2tpd package.
