X11 font editor
	
gbdfed lets you interactively create new bitmap font files or modify existing
ones. it allows editing multiple fonts and multiple glyphs, it allows cut and
paste operations between fonts and glyphs and editing font properties. the
editor works natively with bdf fonts.

this editor is the successor of xmbdfed and is using the gtk+ toolkit instead
of the motif toolkit for better user experience.
