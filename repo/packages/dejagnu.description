Framework for running test suites on software tools
	
dejagnu is a framework for testing other programs.  its purpose is to
provide a single front end for all tests.

dejagnu provides a layer of abstraction which allows you to write
tests that are portable to any host or target where a program must
be tested.  all tests have the same output format.

dejagnu is written in `expect', which in turn uses "tcl"--tool
command language.
