Collection of miscellaneous subroutines
	
data::miscellany is a collection of miscellaneous subroutines useful in wide
but varying scenarios; a catch-all module for things that don't obviously
belong anywhere else.

obviously, what's considered useful differs from person to person, but this
particular collection should be useful in object-oriented frameworks, such
as class::framework and data::conveyor.
