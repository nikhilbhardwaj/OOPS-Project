Linux ansi boot logo
	
this is a little program that may run at login time to produce nice
ansi login logo.

welcome2l intends to produce  the best looking ansi screens by making
full usage of pc graphic characters.

therefore an architecture able to display those characters (i386, alpha with
tga adapter,... ) is required to use it.  and, even if it will work on larger
screens, it will only produce 80 column ansi screens.
