Mocking and testing library
	
mock provides a core mock.mock class that is intended to reduce the
need to create a host of trivial stubs throughout your test suite.
after performing an action, you can make assertions about which methods
/ attributes were used and arguments they were called with. you can
also specify return values and set specific attributes in the normal
way.
