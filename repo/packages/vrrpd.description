Virtual router redundancy protocol user-space implementation
	
this package provides an implementation of vrrpv2 as specified in rfc2338.
it runs in the linux kernel's userspace (as root).

vrrp can be used to setup high-availability services in debian since two
machines can use the same (virtual) ip address which is transfered upon
failover. some kernel features need to be enabled (please read the faq)
