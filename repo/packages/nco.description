Command-line operators to analyze netcdf files
	
nco is a suite of programs known as operators. the operators are stand-alone,
command-line programs executable in a posix shell. operators take one or more
netcdf files as input, perform operations (e.g., averaging, hyperslabbing),
and produce a netcdf output file. nco was originally designed to manipulate and
analyze climate data, though it works on any netcdf format datasets.
