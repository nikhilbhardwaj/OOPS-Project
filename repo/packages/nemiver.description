Standalone graphical debugger for gnome
	
nemiver is a project to write a standalone graphical debugger that
integrates in the gnome desktop. it features a backend which uses
the well known gnu debugger gdb to debug c/c++ programs.

nemiver is built with a plugin system that can offer several different
perspectives. currently the only perspective provided is a debugging
perspective, but it could be expanded with perspectives added for
valgrind, or for profiling tools such as oprofile.
