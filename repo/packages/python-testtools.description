Extensions to the python unittest library
	
testtools (formerly pyunit3k) is a set of extensions to the python standard
library's unit testing framework. these extensions have been derived from
years of experience with unit testing in python and come from many different
sources. it's hoped that these extensions will make their way into the
standard library eventually. also included are backports from python trunk of
unittest features that are not otherwise available to existing unittest users.
