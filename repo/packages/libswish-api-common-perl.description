Swish document indexing made easy
	
swish::api::common offers an easy interface to the swish index engine.
while swish::api offers a complete api, swish::api::common focusses
on ease of use.

currently, swish::api::common just allows for indexing documents
in a single directory and any of its subdirectories. also, don't run
index() and search() in parallel yet.
