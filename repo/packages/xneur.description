In-place conversion of text typed in with a wrong keyboard layout
	
when users work in multilingual environment (e.g. russian+english), they
sometimes type in text with wrong keyboard layout. in auto mode xneur can
automatically detect language of word user typed, switch keyboard layout and
convert word from one keyboard layout into another. in manual mode user has
ability to convert last typed word or some selected text with hot-keys.
the main idea of this utility is similar to punto switcher for ms windows.
for now xneur support english, russian, ukrainian, belarusian, french,
romanian, german, kazakh and many other languages.
