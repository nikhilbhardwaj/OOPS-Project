Advanced metronome for jack
	
klick is an advanced command-line based metronome using the jack sound server.
it allows you to define complex tempo maps for entire songs or performances.

a single meter and tempo can be specified on the command line, while more
complex tempo maps can be read from plain text files.
alternatively, it's also possible to run klick in interactive mode,
where the tempo can be changed at runtime using the keyboard,
or to follow tempo information read from jack transport.
